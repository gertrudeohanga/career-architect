# Philosophy: AI as a Collaborator Manifesto

## Core Principles

1. **Judgment > Code**: Execution is cheap; intent is the value.
2. **Entropy Control**: Prevent "Architectural Fragmentation" and "PR Bloat."
3. **The Elite Pair**: Human Architect owns "Intent"; AI owns "Exploration."
4. **Verification Paradox**: Rigorous testing is the only way to scale AI-generated code.

## Transformation Rules

- Rewrite "Implemented X" -> "Locked architectural intent for X, steering AI exploration for system durability."
- Rewrite "Velocity" -> "Decision Throughput."
- Rewrite "Team Lead" -> "System Leadership & Mentoring on Decision Logic."

## Direct Integration

Do not keep the Manifesto as a separate section only. At least 50% of the Experience bullet points must be rewritten using 'System Leadership' verbs (e.g., 'Locked intent', 'Constrained entropy', 'Steered AI exploration').
