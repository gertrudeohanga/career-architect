Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Assistant Banking position at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's new Resident Office in Nairobi. With my extensive experience in administrative coordination, stakeholder management, and financial services support, I am confident in my ability to provide the high-quality secretarial and administrative support required for this important role.

Throughout my 5+ years of professional experience, I have developed comprehensive administrative skills that align perfectly with your requirements. At Kwendo, I manage administrative support for business development operations, including document preparation, meeting coordination, and stakeholder communication. I regularly organize workshops and seminars, maintain accurate records and databases, and prepare professional correspondence for both internal and external stakeholders - all key responsibilities outlined in your job description.

My experience in the financial services sector has provided me with valuable context for banking operations. I have maintained accurate documentation ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, coordinated with various departments to ensure timely processing, and managed confidential information with appropriate discretion. This background, combined with my excellent English communication skills and proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite, positions me well to support the EBRD's banking operations.

I am particularly drawn to EBRD's commitment to inclusiveness, innovation, trust, and responsibility. My experience working in multicultural environments and collaborating with diverse teams has prepared me to thrive in your international setting. I am known for my proactive attitude, attention to detail, and ability to work efficiently under pressure while managing multiple simultaneous assignments.

The opportunity to contribute to EBRD's mission of extending operations to sub-Saharan African countries is especially appealing. My understanding of the local context, combined with my administrative capabilities and multicultural sensitivity, would enable me to effectively support the Resident Office's operations and help create a positive, efficient working environment for the international teams.

I am excited about the possibility of bringing my organizational skills, professional attitude, and commitment to excellence to EBRD's Nairobi office. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to the smooth operation of your new Resident Office.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
