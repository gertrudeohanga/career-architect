# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Mastercard (Global Payments & Technology)
- **Role**: Manager, Loyalty Specialist Sales
- **Analysis Date**: 2026-02-06

## Match Assessment: 3/10 ❌ Critical Mismatches

### The Deal-Breakers

| JD Requirement | Status | Risk |
|----------------|--------|------|
| **Fluent in English and Arabic** | ❌ No Arabic proficiency known | 🛑 **FATAL** |
| **7-10 years experience** | ⚠️ ~5 years experience | ❌ High |
| **MEA Region Network** | ⚠️ East Africa focus, not broader MEA | ⚠️ Moderate |
| **Technology/Platform Sales** | ⚠️ Financial services sales (loans), not tech platforms | ⚠️ Moderate |

### Strengths (What Aligns)

- **Sales track record**: Proven 120% target achievement.
- **Client Engagement**: Strong relationship management history.
- **Financial Services**: Background in fintech/microfinance (My-Credit, Ngao, etc.).
- **B2B Experience**: Corporate sales exposure.

### Detailed Analysis

1.  **Language Barrier**: The requirement for **Arabic fluency** is explicitly stated as "a must". This usually indicates the role covers the Middle East portion of the MEA region heavily. Without this, your application will likely be screened out immediately.
2.  **Experience Gap**: They ask for 7-10 years driving complex technology solution sales. Your profile is strong in direct financial product sales (loans, insurance) with ~5 years experience. Selling enterprise loyalty platforms is a different, more technical sales cycle.
3.  **Scope**: The role implies a regional scope (MEA - Middle East & Africa), whereas your network is primarily Kenyan/East African.

## Recommendation

> ❌ **Do Not Apply** (Unless you speak Arabic?)
> 
> The Arabic language requirement is typically non-negotiable for MEA regional roles at diverse multinationals like Mastercard, as it involves handling markets like UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc.
> 
> Additionally, the experience gap (5 vs 7-10 years) and the shift from "selling financial products" to "selling complex tech platforms" makes this a very low-probability application.

## Alternative Strategy

Focus on:
- Global companies with specific **East Africa** or **Kenya** focus (not wider MEA requiring Arabic).
- Roles asking for 3-6 years experience.
- "Sales Manager" or "Business Development Manager" titles in Fintech/Payments (where your skills transfer better than in "Loyalty Platform" tech sales).
