# Interview Preparation

## Company Research

### About Mastercard Loyalty Solutions
- **What they do:** Largest loyalty company globally. Provide reward programs, offers, benefits for issuers (banks) and merchants.
- **Key Products:** Personalized Card Linked Offers (PCLO), Pay with Reward Points.
- **Scale:** 600M+ accounts, 2000+ clients.
- **Goal:** Drive usage, extensive engagement, and retention for bank customers.

### The Role's Challenge
- Selling *technical platforms* (SaaS/PaaS style sales) to Banks and huge Merchants.
- Requires navigating complex decision units (C-level, IT, Marketing, Finance).

## Critical Questions Preparation

### The "Arabic Language" Elephant in the Room

**Q: "The role requires Arabic fluency. Do you speak Arabic?"**

*Honest Strategy:*
"I do not speak Arabic, but I am fluent in English and Swahili, which covers the key East African markets. My strength lies in my deep network and understanding of the *Kenyan and East African* financial ecosystem. If the focus for this specific hire is heavily weighted towards the Middle East, I understand if that's a barrier. However, if driving growth in the English-speaking African markets is a priority, I am confident I can deliver immediate results there."

### Sales Strategy (The "Gap" Bridge)

**Q: "You've sold financial products, but have you sold complex technology platforms?"**

*Bridge Answer:*
"While my products have been financial, my *process* is consultative and solution-based, just like platform sales. At Kwendo, I don't just sell a loan; I analyze a client's cash flow, operational gaps, and business goals to structure a solution that fits. I deal with multiple stakeholders to get a deal done. I am a quick learner on technical specs, but the core skill—diagnosing a client’s need and mapping a solution to it—is something I have mastered."

**Q: "How do you manage a complex multi-stakeholder sale?"**

*STAR Answer:*
- **Situation:** At My-Credit, securing a partnership with a large dealer network involved the Owner, the Finance Manager, and the Sales Floor team.
- **Task:** Owner wanted revenue, Finance wanted risk control, Sales team wanted speed.
- **Action:** I tailored my pitch for each. Showed revenue projections to the owner, compliance/security features to Finance, and ease-of-use demo to the Sales team.
- **Result:** Secured the partnership, achieving 120% of target revenue from that channel.

### "Why Mastercard?"

*Sample:*
"Mastercard isn't just a card company; it's a technology company. I want to be at the forefront of the payment and loyalty evolution. I’ve seen how financial access empowers businesses in my previous roles; now I want to help institutions build loyalty and deeper engagement with those customers using Mastercard’s world-class platforms."
