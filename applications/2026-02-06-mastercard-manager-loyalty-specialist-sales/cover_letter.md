Dear Hiring Manager,

With a proven track record of driving revenue growth and managing complex B2B relationships in the financial services sector, I am excited to apply for the Manager, Loyalty Specialist Sales position at Mastercard. I have long admired Mastercard’s commitment to powering economies and empowering people, and I am eager to bring my consultative sales expertise to drive the adoption of your world-class loyalty solutions in the East African market.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I act as a trusted advisor to over 100 corporate clients, identifying their unique business needs and delivering tailored financial solutions. My approach mirrors the consultative selling required for this role—I don't just sell products; I build partnerships that solve problems. I have honed my ability to articulate complex value propositions to diverse stakeholders, ensuring alignment and driving successful outcomes.

Previously at My-Credit Limited, I achieved 120% of my annual revenue targets by leading sales strategies and managing a network of 50+ partners. This experience developed my ability to navigate multi-stakeholder environments and manage multiple complex opportunities simultaneously. I understand the nuances of the financial services landscape in the region and have the established network necessary to open doors and accelerate business growth.

While my background is primarily in English-speaking East African markets, my ability to adapt quickly, coupled with my deep understanding of sales strategy and client engagement, positions me to make an immediate impact. I am a dynamic sales leader who thrives in fast-paced environments, and I am committed to exceeding targets and delivering exceptional value to Mastercard’s clients.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my results-driven approach and regional market expertise can contribute to the success of Mastercard’s Loyalty Solutions team. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
