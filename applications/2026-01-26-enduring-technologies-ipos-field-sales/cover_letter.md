**Subject: Application for iPOS Field Sales Agent Position - [Preferred County]**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the iPOS Field Sales Agent position. With over 5 years of experience in field sales, customer training, and technical support across diverse Kenyan markets, I am confident in my ability to effectively onboard customers, train them on the iPOS platform, and maintain strong relationships for high retention rates.

My field sales background includes extensive experience in customer acquisition and hands-on training. At Ngao Credit Limited, I conducted direct field sales, guiding clients through complete application processes with hands-on assistance. At Kwendo, I implemented systematic client onboarding strategies that improved customer satisfaction and retention, while providing training on digital platform features and benefits. This experience has prepared me well for setting up iPOS on customer devices and training them on effective usage.

I have proven technical support capabilities that align perfectly with the troubleshooting requirements of this role. At Code Particles, I served as first-line technical support, performing remote troubleshooting and guiding customers through problem-solving processes. I'm proficient with mobile technology and have experience with mobile banking platforms like Mpesa and KCB Mtaani, which has given me a strong foundation for understanding mobile applications and digital solutions.

My field experience across multiple Kenyan counties makes me ideally suited for this position. I have worked in Turkana, Isiolo, and other regions, conducting community outreach and providing services in rural areas. This experience has taught me how to adapt to different local business environments and communicate effectively across diverse cultural contexts. I'm comfortable with extensive travel and field work requirements.

I am particularly drawn to this role because it combines my strengths in sales, training, and technology adoption. I understand the importance of digitizing operations for SMEs and Agrodealers, and I'm excited about the opportunity to help businesses streamline their operations through the iPOS platform. My experience in financial services has given me insight into the challenges small businesses face and how technology can help solve them.

I am fluent in both English and Swahili, have strong Microsoft Office skills, and am a self-motivated individual with keen attention to detail. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my field sales experience, technical support skills, and customer training abilities can contribute to the success of the iPOS platform in your assigned counties.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
