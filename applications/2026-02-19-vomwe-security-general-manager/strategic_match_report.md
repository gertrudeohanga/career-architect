# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Vomwe Security Limited
- **Role**: General Manager
- **Analysis Date**: 2026-02-19
- **Industry**: Private Security Services
- **Location**: Kitengela, Kenya
- **Salary**: KSh 30,000 - 45,000

## 📊 Overall Assessment

**Match Score**: 3/10

**Recommendation**: ❌ **DO NOT APPLY** - Critical industry experience gaps are disqualifying

## ⚠️ Critical Disqualifying Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Reality Check |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 7 Years Security Industry Experience | CRITICAL | You have ZERO security industry experience. This is explicitly required and non-negotiable. |
| K9/Canine Unit Management | CRITICAL | You have no experience with guard dogs, K9 operations, or canine security units. |
| Surveillance Systems Management | CRITICAL | You have no experience with night surveillance operations or security surveillance systems. |
| Security Personnel Deployment | CRITICAL | You have no experience deploying, supervising, or managing security guards. |
| Security Regulations & Licensing | CRITICAL | You have no knowledge of private security regulations, licensing requirements, or compliance. |
| 3 Years Senior Security Management | CRITICAL | You have no senior management experience in the security sector. |

## 💰 Compensation Reality Check

- **Offered**: KSh 30,000 - 45,000
- **Your Expectations**: KSh 90,000 - 200,000
- **Gap**: 50-85% BELOW your minimum expectations

This represents a **massive pay cut** and is not aligned with your career level or financial needs.

## 🚫 Why This is a Terrible Match

1. **Zero Security Experience**: The role requires 7 years in security - you have none
2. **Specialized Knowledge Gap**: K9 operations, surveillance, security deployment are completely outside your experience
3. **Massive Salary Cut**: 30-45K is 50-85% below your minimum expectations
4. **Wrong Career Direction**: This moves you away from your business development strengths
5. **Contract Position**: No job security
6. **Location**: Kitengela (outside Nairobi)

## ✅ What You Should Do Instead

**Focus on your STRONG matches**:
- **Autocom Japan Kenya** (8/10) - Sales Representative
- **Decathlon** (7/10) - Business Developer Wholesale  
- **Primano Global** (7/10) - Business Development Officer

These roles align with your strengths, offer better compensation, and have realistic success probability.

## Final Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED** with this application. It is a waste of your time and energy. The security industry experience requirement is absolute and cannot be overcome with transferable skills arguments.

**If you still insist on proceeding**, understand that:
- Success probability: <5%
- You will need to explain why you want a 50-85% pay cut
- You will need to explain why you want to enter security operations with zero experience
- This application will likely be immediately rejected

**Type "CANCEL" to stop, or confirm you understand the risks and want to proceed anyway.**
