Dear Hiring Manager,

With over five years of experience in business development, team
leadership, and high-performance sales, I am writing to apply for the
Business Development Manager position at Dual & All. My background in
driving revenue growth, managing sales teams (leading over 50 client
groups), and executing offline marketing strategies aligns well with
your requirements for lead generation and performance tracking.

In my previous role at My-Credit Limited, I achieved 120% of my annual
sales targets by implementing rigorous lead generation strategies and
effectively managing a large network of partners. I have extensive
experience in “offline property marketing” equivalents—such as market
storms and field activations—which I used to build brand visibility and
drive sales. My ability to track performance, analyze market trends, and
report on key metrics ensured that my team consistently met and exceeded
expectations.

While my primary industry experience has been in financial services, the
principles of selling high-value assets and services are identical to
real estate sales: building trust, understanding client needs, and
guiding them through a significant financial decision. I am a quick
learner with strong analytical skills and a proven ability to lead teams
to success. My experience at Kwendo acquiring 100+ corporate clients
demonstrates my ability to close deals at a B2B level, which translates
directly to managing high-value real estate transactions.

I am eager to bring my leadership skills, discipline, and proven sales
track record to Dual & All to drive your business development goals. I
am available for an interview at your earliest convenience to discuss
how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
