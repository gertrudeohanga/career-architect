# Interview Preparation

## Company Research
- **Name:** Dual & All
- **Industry:** Real Estate / Property
- **Focus:** Likely land sales, property management, or development (Standard Nairobi Real Estate model).
- **Core Business:** Selling plots/land/houses to individuals and investors.

## Key Competencies to Demonstrate
1.  **Lead Generation:** How do you find people with money to buy land?
2.  **Closing:** How do you convert a site visit into a sale?
3.  **Team Management:** How do you motivate a team of agents?
4.  **Resilience:** Real estate is tough; rejection is common.

## Likely Interview Questions

### Sales Strategy
**Q: "You have experience in finance/loans. How will you sell Real Estate?"**
*Answer:* "The product differs, but the psychology is the same. Both are high-value, trust-based decisions. In loans, I sold 'financial possibility'. In real estate, I sell 'security and investment'. My process—prospecting, needs analysis, site visit/demo, closing—remains the same. I just need to learn your specific inventory."

**Q: "How do you generate leads?"**
*Answer:* "I use a mix of offline and network strategies.
1. **Referrals:** My strongest source (30% of my past business). I treat every client well so they bring their friends.
2. **Activations:** Corporate visits, market storms (offline marketing).
3. **Networking:** Attending investment groups (Chamas) which I worked with extensively at My-Credit."

### Leadership
**Q: "Tell us about your team management experience."**
*Answer:* "At My-Credit, I recruited and managed over 50 dealer/client groups. I trained them on products, monitored their performance weekly, and accompanied them on field visits to help close difficult deals. I believe in leading from the front—showing them how it's done, not just telling them."

**Q: "How do you track performance?"**
*Answer:* "I am data-driven. I track key metrics: Calls made -> Site Visits booked -> Site Visits attended -> Offers -> Closed Sales. If a team member has high calls but low visits, I know they need help with the pitch. If they have high visits but low sales, they need help with closing. I use reports to diagnose and fix issues."

### Experience Alignment
**Q: "We asked for Digital Marketing experience. Do you have any?"**
*Answer:* "My strength is definitely offline/field marketing and closing. However, I am digitally savvy—I use CRM tools, LinkedIn for prospecting, and I am a quick learner on digital ad platforms. I can collaborate with a digital agency or learn the basics quickly to support the team."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the primary product focus right now? Land, residential units, or commercial?"
2.  "Does the BD Manager lead a team of in-house sales staff or independent agents?"
3.  "What are the targets for the first 90 days?"
