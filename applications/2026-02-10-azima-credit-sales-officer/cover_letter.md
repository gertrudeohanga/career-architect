Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Credit Sales Officer position at Azima Financial Services in Kampala. As a credit professional who has spent the last five years working with microfinance institutions (My-Credit Limited) and secured lenders (Ngao Credit) to serve the underbanked, I deeply understand the mission of Azima. I am ready to bring my experience in credit sales, portfolio management, and collections to help shape the growth of your operations in Uganda.

**Why I am a distinctive match for Azima:**

1.  **Microfinance & Credit Sales Acumen:** At My-Credit Limited, I didn't just sell loans; I managed the health of a portfolio serving over 50 partner groups. I understand that in microfinance, "sales" is only half the job—the other half is rigorous vetting and relationship-based collections. I have the "nose" for a good customized loan and the discipline to filter out high-risk prospects early.

2.  **Start-up Operational Growth:** I understand that Azima is a start-up, which means you need people who can build processes, not just follow them. In my current role at Kwendo (a fintech start-up), I have helped optimize client onboarding and service delivery workflows. I am comfortable wearing multiple hats and deputizing for leadership when required to keep the business moving.

3.  **Collections & Recovery:** I am not afraid of the difficult conversations. I have extensive experience in assisting with the recovery of outstanding fees and managing late payments through firm but ethical negotiation. I view collections as part of the customer service cycle—preserving the relationship while securing the asset.

**Relocation:**
While I am currently based in Nairobi, I am fully prepared to relocate to Kampala for this opportunity. I view the East African region as a single economic block and am eager to apply my skills in the Ugandan market.

I am excited about the prospect of contributing to Azima's vision of financial inclusion. I possess the grit, the credit acumen, and the collaborative spirit to be a high-impact member of your team from day one. I look forward to discussing how I can drive your credit sales targets.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
