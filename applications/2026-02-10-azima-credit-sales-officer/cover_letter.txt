Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Credit Sales Officer position at Azima Financial Services in Kampala. With over 5 years of experience in microfinance (My-Credit) and secured lending (Ngao Credit), I have the proven ability to drive credit sales, manage portfolio quality, and execute collections in the East African market.

At My-Credit Limited, I managed a loan portfolio serving over 50 partner groups. I understand that effective credit sales require rigorous upfront vetting and relationship-based collections. I have a strong track record of minimizing Portfolio at Risk (PAR) by filtering prospects effectively and negotiating ethical repayment plans when necessary.

As a current Business Development Manager at a fintech start-up (Kwendo), I offer more than just sales skills; I bring the ability to build operational processes and optimize workflows. I am comfortable wearing multiple hats and can assist in shaping Azima's growth strategy from day one.

Although currently based in Nairobi, I view East Africa as a single economic block and am fully prepared to relocate to Kampala for this opportunity. I am eager to apply my grit and credit acumen to drive financial inclusion in Uganda.

I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Azima’s success.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
