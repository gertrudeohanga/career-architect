# Interview Preparation

## Company Research
- **Name:** Azima Financial Services Limited.
- **Type:** Start-up Microfinance / Money Lender.
- **Mission:** Financial services for the **underbanked and unbanked**.
- **Services:** Micro loans (individuals/micro-biz) and Business loans (SMEs).
- **Location:** Kampala, Uganda.
- **Key Insight:** As a start-up, they need **Reliability** and **Versatility**. They can't afford bad loans (PAR).

## Core Themes for Questions

### 1. Credit Sales vs. Just "Sales"
**Question:** "How is selling a loan different from selling a product?"
**Answer:** "When you sell a product, the transaction ends when they pay. When you sell a loan, the relationship *begins*. A 'sale' in credit is only successful if the money comes back. I focus on **Quality over Quantity**—filtering prospects who have the capacity and willingness to repay."

### 2. Portfolio Quality (PAR)
**Question:** "How do you ensure your clients repay on time?"
**Answer:**
- **Upfront Vetting:** "I check their cash flow, not just their stories."
- **Relationship:** "I stay in touch *before* the due date, not just after."
- **Early Warning:** "If a client goes quiet, I visit them immediately."

### 3. Collections
**Question:** "Tell me about a time you recovered a difficult debt."
**Answer:** *Use the My-Credit experience.* "I had a group leader who was delaying payments. Instead of getting aggressive immediately, I visited their business to understand the cash flow gap. We restructured the payment plan slightly to match their market days, and they cleared the balance in full within 3 weeks. It preserved the relationship and saved the money."

### 4. Relocation (The Kampala Question)
**Question:** "You are in Nairobi. Why Uganda? Will you stay?"
**Answer:** "I see East Africa as one market. I am looking for career growth in a dynamic start-up environment, and Azima offers that. I am ready to move and fully commit to building the brand in Kampala."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "Since Azima is a start-up, what is the current biggest challenge in the loan origination process that you want the new CSOs to solve?"
2.  "What is the current NPL (Non-Performing Loan) ratio you are targeting for this year?"
3.  "Are we focusing more on individual micro-loans or SME business loans in the next quarter?"
