Dear RateHawk Hiring Team,

With over five years of experience driving B2B partner acquisition,
relationship management, and revenue growth across East Africa, I am
excited to apply for the Business Development Manager position. While my
background is in financial services rather than travel, my proven
ability to sign up, train, and grow partner networks translates directly
to RateHawk’s mission of expanding your travel-tech platform through
tour operators, agencies, and OTAs.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I have
acquired 100+ business partners through strategic prospecting, delivered
comprehensive platform training to drive system adoption, and managed a
diverse portfolio ensuring long-term cooperation and satisfaction. At
My-Credit Limited, I achieved 120% of sales targets by developing 50+
B2B partner relationships, managing the full sales lifecycle from
initial engagement through commercial deal execution and compliance
monitoring. These experiences have built my expertise in exactly what
this role requires: partner acquisition, onboarding, training, portfolio
management, and CRM-based reporting.

I am drawn to RateHawk because of the opportunity to apply my B2B sales
methodology in the dynamic travel-tech sector. The core
competencies—building relationships with business partners, training
them on digital platforms, managing commercial agreements, and driving
territory growth—are identical to what I do today. What differs is the
industry, and I am eager to rapidly develop deep knowledge of East
Africa’s travel market to complement my sales execution skills.

I am fluent in both English and Swahili, based in Nairobi, comfortable
with extensive travel for client meetings and industry events, and
excited about contributing to RateHawk’s East African expansion. I would
welcome the opportunity to discuss how my B2B development track record
can accelerate your regional growth.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
