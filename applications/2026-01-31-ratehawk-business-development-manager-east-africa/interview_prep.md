## Addressing the Career Pivot

### Key Question: "You have no travel industry experience. Why should we hire you?"

*Sample Answer:*
"You're right that I'm new to travel, but I bring five years of exactly what this role requires: B2B partner acquisition, platform training, portfolio management, and commercial deal execution. At Kwendo, I've onboarded 100+ business partners on a digital platform - the same process you need for tour operators. At My-Credit, I achieved 120% of targets developing B2B relationships. The sales methodology is identical; what's different is the product. I'm a fast learner, and I'm genuinely excited about the travel industry. I'll bring my proven sales execution while rapidly building travel market knowledge."

### Likely Interview Questions

**Q1: What do you know about the East African travel market?**

*Prepare to discuss:*
- Kenya as a tourism hub (wildlife safaris, coastal tourism)
- Growth of domestic and regional travel post-pandemic
- Key players: tour operators, safari companies, OTAs
- B2B distribution: how agencies source hotel inventory
- Mention willingness to learn deeply if hired

**Q2: How would you approach signing up new travel agency partners?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'd start with research to identify high-potential agencies - those with volume but perhaps using outdated booking methods. Then I'd reach out with a value proposition focused on their pain points: better rates, easier booking, reliability. I'd offer a demo of the platform, provide comprehensive training, and maintain regular follow-up to ensure adoption. This is exactly what I did at Kwendo for fintech adoption - the process translates directly."

**Q3: Describe your experience managing a partner portfolio.**

*Sample Answer:*
"At Kwendo, I manage 100+ business accounts. This means regular check-ins, understanding their needs, identifying upsell opportunities, and being their first point of contact for issues. I track everything in CRM, monitor usage patterns, and proactively reach out when I see opportunities to deepen cooperation. I'd bring the same systematic approach to travel agency partners."

**Q4: How do you feel about 30% travel for this role?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'm fully comfortable with travel. In my current and previous roles, field visits to clients have been essential. I understand that building relationships with travel partners requires face-to-face meetings and attendance at industry events. I'm based in Nairobi with flexibility to travel across East Africa as needed."

**Q5: What attracts you to travel-tech specifically?**

*Sample Answer:*
"Two things: First, travel is a growing industry in East Africa with huge B2B potential. Second, I love the intersection of technology and sales - at Kwendo, I've seen how digital platforms transform traditional industries. RateHawk's model of enabling travel agencies through technology aligns with my passion for using platforms to drive business growth."
