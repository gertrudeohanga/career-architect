- **Partner onboarding**: Experience training clients on platforms (Kwendo)
- **Portfolio management**: Managing multiple client accounts
- **Commercial deals**: Processing deals with documentation

## Recommendation

> ⚠️ **Industry Mismatch** - This role specifically requires travel industry experience which you lack. The B2B sales skills transfer, but the travel network knowledge gap is significant.

## Alternative Approach

If interested in travel-tech:
- Consider entry-level sales roles in travel companies first
- Build network in travel industry through events/associations
- This role may be better suited after gaining travel industry exposure
