## Weak Point Analysis & Defense

### Gap 1: No Event Technology Experience

**Defense Strategy**:
- "While I haven't worked specifically in event technology, I've successfully learned new technology platforms quickly. At Kwendo, I ramped up on HR-tech within 30 days. I'm confident I can apply the same approach to learning InEvent's platform, especially given your emphasis on training and development."

### Gap 2: Title Appears Junior vs. Current Role

**Defense Strategy**:
- "I see this as an opportunity to enter the event technology industry with a strong foundation. My BD experience means I can contribute immediately while learning the industry specifics. I'm focused on growth and learning, not just titles."

### Gap 3: Design/Presentation Focus

**Defense Strategy**:
- "I have experience creating client-facing proposals and presentations for C-suite stakeholders. While I may not be a graphic designer, I understand how to structure compelling materials that communicate value clearly. I'm eager to develop design skills as part of this role."
