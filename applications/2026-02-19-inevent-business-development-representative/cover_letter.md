Dear InEvent Hiring Team,

The opportunity to join InEvent as a Business Development Representative immediately captured my attention—not just because of your leadership in global event technology, but because this role sits at the intersection of what I do best: building relationships, supporting sales teams, and learning innovative technology platforms. With 5+ years of B2B sales experience and a proven track record of exceeding targets by 120-130%, I'm excited to bring my customer engagement expertise to your fast-growing team.

At Kwendo, I currently support sales initiatives for an HR-tech platform, where I identify and qualify B2B clients, create compelling sales materials for C-suite presentations, and maintain meticulous CRM records that drive pipeline forecasting. Previously at Ngao Credit, I built a systematic lead qualification framework that consistently achieved 120% of monthly targets while generating a 35% repeat business rate through relationship-focused engagement. These experiences have taught me that successful sales support requires both the organizational discipline to maintain accurate records and the interpersonal skills to build genuine connections with prospects.

What draws me to InEvent is your commitment to continuous learning and professional development. While my background is in fintech and HR-tech rather than event technology, I've demonstrated the ability to quickly master new platforms and translate technical capabilities into customer-facing value propositions. Your emphasis on training and supporting motivated individuals who are "willing to learn and grow" aligns perfectly with my approach—I thrive when given the opportunity to develop expertise in innovative technology while contributing to team revenue goals.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my lead qualification experience, CRM proficiency, and customer engagement skills can support InEvent's growth objectives. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
