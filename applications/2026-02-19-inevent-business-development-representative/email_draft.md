## Email Body

Subject: Application: Business Development Representative - Nairobi | 5+ Years B2B Sales Experience

Dear InEvent Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Business Development Representative position based in Nairobi. With 5+ years of B2B sales experience and a consistent track record of exceeding targets by 120-130%, I am excited about the opportunity to support InEvent's growth in the global event technology market.

**Why I'm a Strong Fit:**

- **Lead Qualification Expertise**: Built systematic frameworks for identifying, qualifying, and nurturing prospects across technology and fintech platforms
- **CRM Proficiency**: Maintained accurate records supporting pipeline forecasting and team coordination
- **Multi-Channel Engagement**: Experienced in phone, email, and field-based customer outreach
- **Sales Support Skills**: Created compelling presentations and proposals for C-suite stakeholders
- **Learning Agility**: Successfully transitioned across industries (microfinance → HR-tech) with rapid ramp-up

I am particularly drawn to InEvent's emphasis on continuous learning and professional development. While my background is in fintech and HR-tech, I am confident in my ability to quickly master event technology solutions, as demonstrated by my track record of learning new platforms efficiently.

I have attached my resume and cover letter for your review. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my customer engagement skills and sales support experience can contribute to InEvent's revenue goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
