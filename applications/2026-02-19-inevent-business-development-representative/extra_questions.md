## Which InEvent value do you most identify with? Quote one and tell a previous situation.

**Value: "WOW Moment 😍"**

*"The service to our client must be incredible. We have to go one step further to make your experience unique. We should help even when we do not have the right product, perhaps by indicating other suppliers. A satisfied customer is the best recommendation we can have."*

**Situation:**

At Ngao Credit, a client came to me urgently needing funds for a business opportunity, but their vehicle documentation wasn't complete enough to qualify for our logbook loan product. Rather than simply declining the application, I spent time understanding their full situation and connected them with a microfinance institution that offered unsecured business loans—even though this meant losing that sale for myself.

Two months later, that same client returned when they had proper documentation, specifically requested to work with me, and referred three additional customers. The "WOW moment" I created by genuinely helping—even when it wasn't directly beneficial to me—turned into long-term relationship value. This experience taught me that going the extra mile for customers always pays dividends, and it's a philosophy I carry into every client interaction.

## What is the craziest thing you have ever done for a customer?

During my time at Kwendo, a client company was struggling to complete their payroll processing for 200+ casual workers before a major holiday weekend. Their HR team had encountered technical issues uploading employee data, and their workers were depending on receiving payment before the holiday.

I personally coordinated with the client's HR manager over a 6-hour video call on a Saturday evening, walking them through data formatting issues line by line, troubleshooting upload errors in real-time, and liaising with our technical team to resolve a system glitch. I stayed on the call until 11 PM to ensure every single worker would receive their payment on time.

The "crazy" part? I was technically off-duty, and it wasn't strictly my responsibility to provide that level of hands-on technical support. But knowing that 200+ workers were counting on that payroll—many of whom live paycheck to paycheck—I couldn't just leave it until Monday. The client's CEO personally sent a thank-you message, and they became one of our strongest advocates, referring two other companies to our platform.
