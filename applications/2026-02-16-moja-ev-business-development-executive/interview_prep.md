# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: Electric Vehicles in Kenya
*High Upfront Cost, Low Operating Cost.*
-   **Range Anxiety:** The #1 customer fear. "Will I get stuck?"
-   **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership):** Your main sales tool. "You save 50k/month on fuel."
-   **NETA / Skyworth:** The brands you are selling. Research them (Chinese EVs, premium/tech-focused).

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The Finance Obstacle
**Question:** "The customer loves the car, but says KSh 4M is too expensive. What do you say?"
**Answer:** "I acknowledge the price, then pivot to **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)**. 'Mr. Customer, yes, the upfront is higher. But you currently spend 60k/month on fuel and service for your Prado. This EV costs 5k/month to charge. That’s 660k savings per year. In 3 years, the car has paid for half of itself.' Then I would introduce them to our Asset Finance partners."

### 2. Handling "Range Anxiety"
**Question:** "What if I run out of charge in Naivasha?"
**Answer:** "I would calmly explain the range (e.g., 400km) and show them the growing network of 'Charging Stakes' that Moja EV is rolling out. I’d also explain that they can charge at home overnight, just like their phone. Effective reassurance is key."

### 3. The Test Drive Close
**Question:** "How do you handle a test drive?"
**Answer:** "The test drive is the closing moment.
1.  **Preparation:** Car is clean, charged, and cool.
2.  **During:** I let them feel the *instant torque* and *silence* (the 'wow' factors of EVs).
3.  **After:** I don't ask 'What do you think?' I ask 'Can you see yourself driving this to work tomorrow?' (Trial Close)."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "Does Moja EV have pre-approved asset finance partnerships with major banks (NCBA/Stanbic) to help my customers buy?"
2.  "What is the commission structure on vehicle sales?"
3.  "What is the current delivery timeline for new orders?"
