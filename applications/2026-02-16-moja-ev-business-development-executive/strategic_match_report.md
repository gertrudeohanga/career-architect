# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Moja EV (Electric Vehicle Distributor - NETA/Skyworth).
- **Role**: Business Development Executive (Car Sales).
- **Core Function**: High-Ticket Sales, Showroom/Field Sales.

## Match Assessment: 8/10 ✅ Strong Sales Fit

### The Bridge: From "Auto-Finance" to "Auto-Sales"
1.  **Experience:** They ask for 5+ years. You have exactly 5 years.
2.  **The "Car" Connection:** You worked at **Ngao Credit (Logbook Loans)**. You understand car values, logbooks, asset finance, and the psychology of car owners. We will pivot this: "I don't just know finance; I know cars."
3.  **Hunter Mentality:** You have sold "intangible" financial products. Selling a tangible, exciting product like a sleek EV will be a natural transition.
4.  **Driving:** I am assuming you have a Drivers License (2+ years). If not, this is a blocker.

### The Strategy: "The Consultative Closer"
-   **Highlight:** Your ability to negotiate and close deals (proven by your target-beating history).
-   **Tech Savvy:** Selling EVs requires explaining "Green Technology". We will emphasize your adaptability to new tech products (Electronic Data Collection etc).

## Recommendation

> ✅ **Apply (Exciting Pivot)**
> 
> This is a high-growth sector (EVs). Your background in Asset Finance is a huge plus because most car buyers need financing—you can guide them through that process better than a standard salesman.
