Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Business Development Executive** position at Moja EV. With 5 years of experience in Sales, specifically in the **Asset Finance (Logbook Loans)** sector, I understand that selling a car is not just about the vehicle—it’s about selling the *value*, the *lifestyle*, and the *financial sense*.

**Why I am the engine your sales team needs:**

**1. From Asset Finance to Asset Sales:**
At Ngao Credit and My-Credit, my daily work revolved around motor vehicles. I assessed logbooks, understood valuations, and guided car owners on how to leverage their assets. This means I already understand the "financing" conversation that often blocks a car sale. I can help Moja EV customers navigate financing options to make their purchase reality.

**2. Consultative Selling of "Green Tech":**
I have a track record of selling "intangible" value (financial products). Selling Electric Vehicles requires a similar consultative approach—educating the buyer on fuel savings, maintenance reduction, and long-term ROI. I am patient, articulate, and persuasive.

**3. Hunter Mentality:**
I do not wait for walk-ins. My background is in **Field Sales** and **Territory Mapping**. I am ready to go out and find corporate fleets, taxi associations, and high-net-worth individuals who are ready to switch to NETA or Skyworth EVs.

**4. Driver & Professional:**
I hold a valid driver's license (2+ years) and possess the professional demeanor required to host test drives and represent a premium brand like Moja EV.

I am eager to join Moja EV and drive the revolution in Kenyan transport.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
