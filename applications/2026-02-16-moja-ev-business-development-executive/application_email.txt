Subject: Application for Business Development Executive - Getrude Ohanga

Dear Hiring Manager,

Please accept my application for the Business Development Executive position at Moja EV Kenya.

I am a seasoned Sales Professional with over 5 years of experience in Asset Finance and Business Development. Having worked at Ngao Credit (Logbook Loans), I possess a unique advantage: I understand the intersection of "Automotive Sales" and "Financing".

Key Qualification Highlights:
*   Sales Track Record: Consistently met monthly disbursement targets of KSh 3M+ by selling high-value financial products backed by motor vehicles.
*   Automotive Knowledge: Strong understanding of vehicle valuation, logbook processing, and the asset finance market—critical for guiding customers through an EV purchase.
*   Driving Ability: Valid Driver's License holder (2+ Years) with a clean record and a passion for automotive technology.

I am eager to apply my "Hunter" sales mentality to drive the adoption of NETA and Skyworth EVs in Kenya.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
