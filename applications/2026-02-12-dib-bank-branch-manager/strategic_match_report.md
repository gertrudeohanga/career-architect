# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: DIB Bank Kenya (Islamic Banking - Niche, Ethical, Asset-backed).
- **Role**: Branch Manager.
- **Critical Requirement**: 4 Years similar experience + Nairobi CBD experience.

## Match Assessment: 6/10 ⚠️ High Stretch (Vertical Step Up)

### The Gap (Why this is hard)
1.  **"Similar Role" Requirement**: You have been an *Area Sales Lead* and *Business Development Manager*, but not a *Branch Manager*. You haven't managed a Vault, Tellers, or physical Branch Ops (Security, Keys, Cash Center).
2.  **Banking Experience**: While you have Fintech/Lending experience (My-Credit/Ngao), DIB is a full-service commercial bank. They expect knowledge of "Remittances, Drafts, Account Opening" which are specific banking protocols.

### The Bridge (How we frame it)
To compete, we must frame you as a **"Sales-First Branch Manager"**:
-   **The Argument:** "You can hire an Admin to run the Ops, but you need *Me* to drive the Numbers."
-   **Portfolio Management:** We equate your "50+ Partner Groups" at My-Credit to a Branch Portfolio.
-   **Nairobi CBD:** We must explicitly state your experience working in/covering Nairobi CBD to tick that box.

### Sharia Compliance Angle
-   Even if you aren't Muslim or an expert, we can highlight values aligned with Islamic Finance:
    -   **Asset-Backed Financing:** (Your experience at Ngao/My-Credit involved tangible assets).
    -   **Community Banking:** (Chama/Group lending aligns with collective responsibility).
    -   **Ethical/Transparent Dealing:** Key for DIB.

## Recommendation

> ⚠️ **Apply with Strategy**
> 
> This is a reach. If they have a strong internal candidate or want a veteran banker, you won't get it.
> **However**, if they have a "lazy branch" that needs a kickstart in Sales, you are the perfect candidate.
> **Action:** Resume must scream "Deposit Mobilization" and "Asset Growth".
