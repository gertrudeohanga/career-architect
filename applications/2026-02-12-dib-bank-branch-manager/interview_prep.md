# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: Islamic Banking (DIB)
*You don't need to be an expert, but you must know the basics to show respect and interest.*

-   **Riba:** Interest (Prohibited). DIB deals in *Profit*.
-   **Murabaha:** Cost-plus financing (Bank buys asset, sells to client at markup). most common for cars/homes.
-   **Musharaka:** Partnership (Joint venture).
-   **Ijara:** Leasing.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The "Banking Ops" Gap
**Question:** "You haven't run a bank branch before. How will you manage the vault and tellers?"
**Answer:** "I view the Branch Manager role as **80% Business Leader** and **20% Administrator**.
-   **Ops:** I will rely on my **Branch Operations Manager (BOM)** for the technical vault procedures, while taking full accountability for compliance. I am a fast learner and strict on protocol.
-   **Sales:** Where I add value is getting the team OUT of the branch to bring business IN. I don't want to be a manager who hides behind the vault door."

### 2. Mobilizing Deposits (Liabilities)
**Question:** "How will you bring cheap deposits (CASA) to the branch?"
**Answer:** "I focus on **Relationship ecosystems**.
1.  **Corporate Payrolls:** If we lend to a company (Asset), doing their payroll gives us cheap deposits.
2.  **Chamas/Groups:** My experience at My-Credit with 50+ groups taught me that aggregated small savers create a stable deposit base.
3.  **Customer Service:** People bank where they are treated well. I will ensure our Turnaround Time (TAT) is the best in the CBD."

### 3. Staff Management
**Question:** "How do you handle a teller who is short on cash?"
**Answer:** "There is a strict protocol.
1.  **Immediate declaration:** It must be reported instantly.
2.  **Investigation:** Was it error or theft? Review CCTV.
3.  **Action:** If negligence, disciplinary action. If theft, police/dismissal.
4.  **Support:** As a leader, I also ensure my staff are not fatigued or distracted, which causes errors."

### 4. Sharia Compliance
**Question:** "What do you know about Islamic Banking?"
**Answer:** "I know it is based on **Fairness, Transparency, and Asset-Backing**. Unlike conventional banks that sell 'money', DIB partners with clients to buy 'assets'. This aligns with my experience at Ngao and My-Credit where the loan was always tied to a tangible purpose or asset."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the current mix of the branch's ambition—is it more focused on **Retail Growth** or **SME/Corporate** acquisition?"
2.  "How does DIB support branches with marketing materials for specifically Sharia-compliant products?"
3.  "What is the biggest challenge the Nairobi CBD branch is facing right now?"
