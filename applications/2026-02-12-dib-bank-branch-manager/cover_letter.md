Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Branch Manager** position at **DIB Bank Kenya**. With extensive experience managing high-performing portfolios and driving asset growth within Nairobi’s competitive financial services market, I am eager to bring my sales-led leadership style to your branch network.

While my background involves Fintech and Non-Bank Financial Institutions (My-Credit, Ngao, Kwendo), the core of my success has always been **Profit Center Management**—the exact mandate of a modern Branch Manager.

**Why I am the right fit for DIB Bank:**

**1. Driving Liabilities and Assets:**
A branch is a sales engine. At My-Credit Limited, I managed a portfolio of **50+ partner groups**, effectively running a "virtual branch." I was responsible for mobilizing deposits (savings for security) and growing the asset book (lending). I grew my cluster’s revenue by 120% through aggressive relationship management and targeted acquisition of High-Net-Worth individuals and mobilized groups.

**2. Understanding Asset-Backed Finance:**
I have specific experience with asset-backed products (Ngao Credit), which aligns well with the principles of Islamic Finance (financing tangible assets rather than pure money-lending). I understand the importance of underlying assets, transparency, and ethical risk-sharing, making me a quick study for Sharia-compliant products.

**3. Operational Excellence & Audit:**
I know that sales cannot come at the expense of compliance. I have a track record of maintaining Portfolio at Risk (PAR) below 5% and ensuring 100% adherence to KYC and credit policies. I bring the discipline required to maintain a "low risk" audit rating while pushing for aggressive market expansion.

**4. Nairobi CBD Experience:**
I have actively worked and managed relationships within Nairobi CBD and its environs for over 4 years. I understand the pace, the competition, and the client profile of the city center.

I am ready to lead your branch with energy, integrity, and a relentless focus on the bottom line.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
