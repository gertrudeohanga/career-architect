# Strategic Match Report: Kenyan Alliance Insurance

**Role:** Business Development Manager - General Business
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Match Score:** 7/10

## Executive Summary
Strong fit for the Business Development aspect of the role, backed by extensive experience in the financial services and microfinance sectors. While direct "Insurance" industry experience and COP certification are potential gaps, the transferable skills from Fintech, Lending, and Microfinance are highly relevant. The core responsibilities of sourcing new business, cross-marketing, and market development align perfectly with your recent achievements at Kwendo and My-Credit.

## Key Selling Points

1.  **Proven Business Development Track Record:**
    -   Your role at **Kwendo** (BD Manager) and **Tenakata** (BD Officer) directly demonstrates the ability to "source for new business" and "develop new markets," which are key responsibilities for this role.
    -   Experience leading "field-based business development initiatives" and "sales strategies" maps directly to the requirement for "identifying and exploiting new business opportunities."

2.  **Financial Services & Cross-Selling Expertise:**
    -   Experience at **Ngao Credit** and **My-Credit Limited** involves selling financial products (loans), which is closely related to selling insurance.
    -   "Cross marketing across other business lines" is a key skill you've demonstrated by expanding client portfolios and recommending tailored financial solutions.

3.  **Market Expansion & Strategy:**
    -   You have a history of "exploring opportunities to develop new markets" (e.g., Kwendo's expansion, Tenakata's loan mobilization).
    -   Your background in research (Laterite, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake) adds value for "preparing relevant production reports" and market intelligence.

## Gap Analysis & Mitigation Strategies

| Gap | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **5 Years Insurance Experience** | Frame your 5+ years in **Financial Services (Fintech, Microfinance, Credit)** as directly transferable. Emphasize that you have been selling complex financial products, which requires similar trust-building and explanation skills as insurance. |
| **COP Certification** | If you do not have this, express a strong willingness to obtain it immediately. Highlight your rapid learning capabilities and relevant degree in Gender & Development (social sciences) which serves as a good foundation. |

## Application Strategy
-   **Keywords to Emphasize:** Business Development, New Market Creation, Strategic Partnerships, Cross-selling, Financial Services, Sales Strategy, Client Relations, Portfolio Growth.
-   **Narrative Arc:** Position yourself as a "Growth Architect" who has successfully driven revenue and expansion in the financial sector and is now pivoting that expertise to the Insurance industry.
