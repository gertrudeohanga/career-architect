# Interview Preparation Guide: Kenyan Alliance Insurance

**Role:** Business Development Manager - General Business
**Company:** Kenyan Alliance Insurance

## Key Themes & Strategy

1.  **Transferability:** Since you don't have direct insurance experience, pivot every question back to **Sales**, **Relationship Management**, and **Financial Services**.
    -   *Example:* "While I haven't sold insurance policies directly, I have sold complex financial instruments like loans and digital payroll solutions. The core skill of explaining value, building trust, and closing deals is identical."

2.  **Market Expansion:** Focus on your ability to open new markets (Kwendo expansion, Tenakata mobilization).
    -   *Story:* Tell the story of how you grew the client base at Kwendo by 40% in 6 months.

3.  **Cross-Selling:** Highlight your experience at Ngao and My-Credit in cross-selling to existing clients.
    -   *Insight:* Insurance is often about bundling (Auto + Life + Home). Show you understand this dynamic.

## potential Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. "Why do you want to work in Insurance if your background is in Fintech/Microfinance?"
*Answer:* "I see a massive opportunity in the insurance sector right now. Just like in Fintech, the goal is financial security for the client. I've spent my career helping people access financial tools—whether it's loans to grow their business or payroll systems for efficiency. Insurance is the protective layer of that financial health. I want to bring my aggressive business development approach from the fast-paced fintech world to help Kenyan Alliance capture more market share."

### 2. "How would you source for new business in the Kericho region?"
*Answer:* "I would start by leveraging my existing network and conducting a rapid market mapping exercise, similar to what I did at Tenakata. I’d identify under-served SMEs and cooperatives. My approach is 'Consultative Selling'—I don't just pitch a product; I diagnose their business risk. For example, a tea farmer cooperative needs different coverage than a retail shop. I would tailor my pitch to these segments, and also look for partnership opportunities with local Saccos to cross-sell products."

### 3. "You don't have a COP certification. How will you handle the technical aspects?"
*Answer:* "I am fully aware of the importance of the COP and I am ready to enroll immediately. However, my strength lies in the *commercial* aspect—opening doors and closing deals. I am a quick learner; I mastered the technicalities of digital payroll at Kwendo and loan underwriting at My-Credit very quickly. I will lean on the technical underwriting team for the complex policy details while I focus on bringing the client to the table."

### 4. "Describe a time you failed to meet a target and how you handled it."
*Answer:* "At My-Credit, there was a month where broad economic factors slowed down lending. I missed my target by 10%. Instead of making excuses, I analyzed my pipeline. I realized I was relying too much on cold leads. I pivoted to asking for referrals from my happiest existing clients. The next month, I not only met the target but exceeded it by 15% because referrals convert faster. I learned that in a downturn, you lean on your relationships."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the biggest challenge the General Business unit in Kericho is facing right now?"
2.  "How does the team currently balance between hunting for new business and farming existing accounts?"
3.  "What support does the company provide for obtaining the COP certification?"
