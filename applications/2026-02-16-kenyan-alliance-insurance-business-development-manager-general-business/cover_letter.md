Hiring Manager
Kenyan Alliance Insurance
Kericho, Kenya

**RE: APPLICATION FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT MANAGER - GENERAL BUSINESS**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Business Development Manager position at Kenyan Alliance Insurance. With over 6 years of experience driving business growth, market expansion, and strategic partnerships within the financial services and fintech sectors, I am confident in my ability to deliver immediate value to your General Business unit in Kericho.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at **Kwendo**, I have successfully spearheaded field-based initiatives that expanded our market presence across East Africa. My responsibility for "sourcing for new business" directly mirrors the core mandate of your vacant position. I developed and executed sales strategies that resulted in a 40% increase in client acquisition within six months, demonstrating my capacity to identify and exploit new business opportunities for sustainable growth.

My tenure at **Ngao Credit Limited** and **My-Credit Limited** provided me with deep exposure to the financial lending landscape, where I honed my skills in cross-marketing products and managing client relationships. I consistently exceeded sales targets by not only acquiring new clients but also by identifying opportunities for up-selling and cross-selling financial solutions to arguably the most diverse client base in the region. This experience is directly transferable to the insurance sector, where trust, needs assessment, and product suitability are paramount.

While my background is rooted in financial services and fintech, the fundamental principles of business development—building relationships, understanding market needs, and driving revenue—remain constant. I am eager to bring my rigorous approach to market research, which I utilized at **Tenakata Enterprise** to identify high-value segments, to Kenyan Alliance Insurance to help you develop new markets and segments in line with your sales strategy.

I possess a Bachelor’s degree in Gender and Development from Egerton University, which has equipped me with unique insights into diverse market demographics and community-level engagement—an asset when penetrating new regional markets. I am also fully committed to obtaining any specific insurance certifications, such as the COP, to complement my practical sales and management expertise.

Accompanying this letter is my CV, which provides further details on my professional achievements. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in business development and financial services can contribute to the continued success of Kenyan Alliance Insurance.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
