Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Business Manager position at TASEC Group.
With over 5 years of experience driving revenue and managing operations
in the dynamic Financial Services and Technology sectors, I am
well-positioned to support TASEC’s growth across its diversified
portfolio.

Why I am the right Business Manager for TASEC:

1. Track Record of Revenue Growth: My core strength is Commercial
Execution. At Ngao Credit and Kwendo, I didn’t just sell; I built
strategies to extract value from new markets. I have consistently
exceeded revenue targets (managing portfolios of up to KSh 50M) by
identifying untapped opportunities and structuring deals that ensure
profitability.

2. Operational Leadership: I understand that revenue needs a backbone of
strong operations. As a Team Lead at Kwendo, I oversaw the day-to-day
logistics, budgeting, and performance management of my unit. I am
experienced in translating high-level efficiency goals into daily
workflows that my team can execute.

3. Strategic Client Management: TASEC operates in Consulting, Real
Estate, and Tech—industries that rely on trust. I have spent 5 years
managing relationships with SME owners and corporate clients. I know how
to negotiate contracts, manage expectations, and turn a one-off
transaction into a long-term partnership.

4. Versatility: Having worked in Fintech (Tenakata) and Asset Finance
(Ngao), I am adaptable. I can pivot between discussing tech solutions
and financial strategy seamlessly, a skill that fits TASEC’s diversified
business model.

I am eager to bring my drive for performance and operational excellence
to the TASEC Group.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
