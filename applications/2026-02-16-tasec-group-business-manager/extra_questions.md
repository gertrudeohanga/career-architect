# Extra Application Questions (Fuzu Strategic Management Test)

## Strategic Management Test

### Question 1: Project Timeline Estimation
**Scenario:** Your company’s Uganda Country Head has brought a project to the strategy team... The team has closed a similar project before in Kenya... approximate time 2 months. Which is the most appropriate response?

**Selected Answer:**
> "Assuming it is similar to a project we have closed before, we estimate between six to ten weeks. However, we can share an exact timeline once we have scoped it"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Best Practice:** This response gives a realistic range (6-10 weeks covers the 2-month estimate) while managing expectations by conditioning the final commitment on a proper "Scope" review.

### Question 2: Non-Profit Campaign Effectiveness
**Scenario:** "For the People (FTP)" non-profit. Goal is to improve campaign effectiveness (Donations / Cost). You conclude the team needs to **focus on increasing the number of donations**.
**Question:** Given your project scope (focus on increasing donations), which would be the **least relevant** question to explore?

**Selected Answer:**
> "How can FTP reduce cost when communicating with their donors?"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Scope Constraint:** The prompt explicitly states: "You conclude that your team needs to **focus on increasing the number of donations**."
*   **Elimination:**
    *   Targeting likely donors -> Increases donations.
    *   Engaging people better -> Increases donations.
    *   Improving execution -> Increases donations.
    *   *Reducing Cost* -> Affects the "efficiency ratio" but **does not** address the specific goal of "increasing the number of contributions". Therefore, it is the least relevant to the defined scope.
