# Extra Application Questions (Fuzu Strategic Management Test)

## Strategic Management Test

### Question 1: Project Timeline Estimation
**Scenario:** Your company’s Uganda Country Head has brought a project to the strategy team... The team has closed a similar project before in Kenya... approximate time 2 months. Which is the most appropriate response?

**Selected Answer:**
> "Assuming it is similar to a project we have closed before, we estimate between six to ten weeks. However, we can share an exact timeline once we have scoped it"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Best Practice:** This response gives a realistic range (6-10 weeks covers the 2-month estimate) while managing expectations by conditioning the final commitment on a proper "Scope" review.

### Question 2: Non-Profit Campaign Effectiveness
**Scenario:** "For the People (FTP)" non-profit. Goal is to improve campaign effectiveness (Donations / Cost). You conclude the team needs to **focus on increasing the number of donations**.
**Question:** Given your project scope (focus on increasing donations), which would be the **least relevant** question to explore?

**Selected Answer:**
> "How can FTP reduce cost when communicating with their donors?"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Scope Constraint:** The prompt explicitly states: "You conclude that your team needs to **focus on increasing the number of donations**."
*   **Elimination:**
    *   Targeting likely donors -> Increases donations.
    *   Engaging people better -> Increases donations.
    *   Improving execution -> Increases donations.
    *   *Reducing Cost* -> Affects the "efficiency ratio" but **does not** address the specific goal of "increasing the number of contributions". Therefore, it is the least relevant to the defined scope.

### Question 3: Institutional Campaign Calculation
**Scenario:** "For the People (FTP)" non-profit. The table shows Donations and Costs.
**Data (From Table):** Institutional: 154, Religious: 153. Cost: Institutional (9), Religious (8).
**Question:** The cost of institutional campaigns is expected to **double** this year. In order to maintain the institutional campaigns effectiveness at the same level as last year, What amount do they need to receive as donations?

**Selected Answer:**
> "$306 Million"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Logic:** To maintain effectiveness when Cost doubles, Donations must double.
*   **Note:** The provided table shows Institutional Donations at **154** (154*2 = 308). However, **153** (Religious) * 2 = **306**.
*   **Decision:** Given "306" is the only valid option close to the calculation, we select it (assuming a test error swapping Institutional/Religious data).

### Question 4: Sales Chart Analysis
**Scenario:** Chart "Sales by Ann in H1 2019".
**Question:** How much sales did Ann close in the first half of 2019 (H1)?

**Data Extraction:**
*   Jan: 55
*   Feb: 20
*   Mar: 60
*   Apr: 55
*   May: 60
*   Jun: 50

**Calculation:**
55 + 20 + 60 + 55 + 60 + 50 = 300 (Thousands)

**Selected Answer:**
> "300,000"

### Question 5: Social Media Effectiveness
**Scenario:** FTP table (Social Media: Donations=282, Cost=22).
**Question:** FTP intends to **double the effectiveness** of social media campaigns. Assuming the cost remains constant, How much donations should the organization target?

**Calculation:**
*   Current Effectiveness = Donations / Cost.
*   Target Effectiveness = 2 * (Donations / Cost).
*   Target Cost = Current Cost.
*   Target Donations = Target Effectiveness * Cost
    *   = (2 * Donations / Cost) * Cost
    *   = 2 * Donations
    *   = 2 * 282 = **564**.

**Selected Answer:**
> "$564 Million"

### Question 6: Competitor Merger Strategy
**Scenario:** You are strategy manager of the region's 2nd largest retailer. Two largest competitors merge to create an entity larger than you.
**Question:** Which potential impact is the **most important** to determine to formulate a suitable response?

**Selected Answer:**
> "Reduction in your company’s pricing power and market share"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Strategic Priority:** A merger of larger competitors creates "Economies of Scale" for them, likely allowing them to lower prices. If they lower prices, you lose **Pricing Power** and subsequently **Market Share**. This is the fundamental strategic threat to your business model. Other factors (Employee count, specific regions) are secondary to this core commercial threat.

### Question 7: Bottled Water Profit Margin
**Scenario:**
*   **My Company:** Price = 100. Margin = 10%.
*   **Competitor:** Price is 10% Lower. Cost is 20% Lower.
**Question:** What is your competitors’ profit margin?

**Calculation:**
1.  **My Cost:**
    *   Margin (10%) = (Price - Cost) / Price
    *   0.10 = (100 - Cost) / 100  -> Cost = **90**.
2.  **Competitor Stats:**
    *   Price = 100 - 10% = **90**.
    *   Cost = 90 - 20% = **72**.
3.  **Competitor Margin:**
    *   Profit = 90 - 72 = 18.
    *   Margin = 18 / 90 = 0.20 = **20%**.

**Selected Answer:**
> "20%"

### Question 8: Explanation for Low Sales (Feb)
**Scenario:** Chart shows Jan-Jun sales. Feb is significantly lower (20k vs >50k avg).
**Key Data Point:** Beside the bar chart, the "# of days Ann worked" column shows Feb = **8 days** (others are 17, 21, 20, 22, 20).
**Question:** Using the chart, which of the following might best explain why Ann had a bad month in February?

**Selected Answer:**
> "Ann got sick and couldn’t work for most of the month"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Data Driven:** The chart explicitly shows she only worked 8 days in February, compared to an average of ~20 days in other months. Being "sick" is a logical explanation for missing work days, which directly explains the low sales volume.

### Question 9: Project Stage 2 Budget
**Scenario:**
*   Actual Cost Stage 1 = $25,000,000.
*   This specific cost was **25% over-budget**.
*   Total Budget for Project (Stage 1 & 2) = $30,000,000.
**Question:** What was the original budget for stage 2?

**Calculation:**
1.  **Original Budget for Stage 1:**
    *   Actual = Original * (1 + 25%)
    *   25,000,000 = Original_S1 * 1.25
    *   Original_S1 = 25,000,000 / 1.25 = **$20,000,000**.
2.  **Original Budget for Stage 2:**
    *   Total Budget = Original_S1 + Original_S2
    *   30,000,000 = 20,000,000 + Original_S2
    *   Original_S2 = 30,000,000 - 20,000,000 = **$10,000,000**.

**Selected Answer:**
> "$10,000,000"

### Question 10: Ann's Efficiency
**Scenario:** Chart shows "Sales" and "Days Worked" for Jan-Jun.
**Question:** Which of the following was Ann’s most efficient month?
**Definition:** Efficiency = Sales generated per day worked.

**Calculations:**
*   **Jan:** 55,000 / 17 ≈ **3,235**
*   **Feb:** 20,000 / 8 = 2,500
*   **Mar:** 60,000 / 21 ≈ 2,857
*   **Apr:** 55,000 / 20 = 2,750
*   **May:** 60,000 / 22 ≈ 2,727
*   **Jun:** 50,000 / 20 = 2,500

**Selected Answer:**
> "January"

### Question 11: Raw Material Cost Reduction
**Scenario:**
*   My Price = 100. My Margin = 10% (So Cost = 90).
*   Competitor Margin = **20%** (Calculated in Q7).
*   Structure: Raw Materials = **70%** of Total Costs.
*   Goal: Match Competitors' Profit Margin (20%).
**Question:** What percentage would raw materials cost have to be decreased by?

**Calculation:**
1.  **Current Cost Breakdown:**
    *   Total Cost = 90.
    *   Raw Materials = 0.70 * 90 = **63**.
    *   Other Costs = 27.
2.  **Target Cost Profile:**
    *   Price = 100 (Assumed constant unless price drop is specified).
    *   Target Margin = 20%.
    *   Target Profit = 20.
    *   Target Total Cost = 100 - 20 = **80**.
3.  **Required Reduction:**
    *   Reduction Needed = Current Cost (90) - Target Cost (80) = **10**.
    *   This reduction must come from Raw Materials.
4.  **Percentage Decrease:**
    *   Raw Mat Decrease = 10 / 63
    *   = 0.1587... ≈ **15.9%**.

**Selected Answer:**
> "15.9%" (or approx 16%)

### Question 12: Fast Food Suppliers
**Scenario:** Fast-food chain manager. Suppliers (Farmers) have fixed the price and won't budge.
**Question:** Which problem do you have?

**Selected Answer:**
> "A supplier power problem"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Porter's Five Forces:** When suppliers can dictate terms and prices without fear of losing business (or when the buyer has no alternative sources), they possess high bargaining power. This is exactly what is described (farmers won't budge).
