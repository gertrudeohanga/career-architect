# Extra Application Questions (Fuzu Strategic Management Test)

## Strategic Management Test

### Question 1: Project Timeline Estimation
**Scenario:** Your company’s Uganda Country Head has brought a project to the strategy team... The team has closed a similar project before in Kenya... approximate time 2 months. Which is the most appropriate response?

**Selected Answer:**
> "Assuming it is similar to a project we have closed before, we estimate between six to ten weeks. However, we can share an exact timeline once we have scoped it"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Best Practice:** This response gives a realistic range (6-10 weeks covers the 2-month estimate) while managing expectations by conditioning the final commitment on a proper "Scope" review.

### Question 2: Non-Profit Campaign Effectiveness
**Scenario:** "For the People (FTP)" non-profit. Goal is to improve campaign effectiveness (Donations / Cost). You conclude the team needs to **focus on increasing the number of donations**.
**Question:** Given your project scope (focus on increasing donations), which would be the **least relevant** question to explore?

**Selected Answer:**
> "How can FTP reduce cost when communicating with their donors?"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Scope Constraint:** The prompt explicitly states: "You conclude that your team needs to **focus on increasing the number of donations**."
*   **Elimination:**
    *   Targeting likely donors -> Increases donations.
    *   Engaging people better -> Increases donations.
    *   Improving execution -> Increases donations.
    *   *Reducing Cost* -> Affects the "efficiency ratio" but **does not** address the specific goal of "increasing the number of contributions". Therefore, it is the least relevant to the defined scope.

### Question 3: Institutional Campaign Calculation
**Scenario:** "For the People (FTP)" non-profit. The table shows Donations and Costs.
**Data (From Table):** Institutional: 154, Religious: 153. Cost: Institutional (9), Religious (8).
**Question:** The cost of institutional campaigns is expected to **double** this year. In order to maintain the institutional campaigns effectiveness at the same level as last year, What amount do they need to receive as donations?

**Selected Answer:**
> "$306 Million"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Logic:** To maintain effectiveness when Cost doubles, Donations must double.
*   **Note:** The provided table shows Institutional Donations at **154** (154*2 = 308). However, **153** (Religious) * 2 = **306**.
*   **Decision:** Given "306" is the only valid option close to the calculation, we select it (assuming a test error swapping Institutional/Religious data).

### Question 4: Sales Chart Analysis
**Scenario:** Chart "Sales by Ann in H1 2019".
**Question:** How much sales did Ann close in the first half of 2019 (H1)?

**Data Extraction:**
*   Jan: 55
*   Feb: 20
*   Mar: 60
*   Apr: 55
*   May: 60
*   Jun: 50

**Calculation:**
55 + 20 + 60 + 55 + 60 + 50 = 300 (Thousands)

**Selected Answer:**
> "300,000"

### Question 5: Social Media Effectiveness
**Scenario:** FTP table (Social Media: Donations=282, Cost=22).
**Question:** FTP intends to **double the effectiveness** of social media campaigns. Assuming the cost remains constant, How much donations should the organization target?

**Calculation:**
*   Current Effectiveness = Donations / Cost.
*   Target Effectiveness = 2 * (Donations / Cost).
*   Target Cost = Current Cost.
*   Target Donations = Target Effectiveness * Cost
    *   = (2 * Donations / Cost) * Cost
    *   = 2 * Donations
    *   = 2 * 282 = **564**.

**Selected Answer:**
> "$564 Million"

### Question 6: Competitor Merger Strategy
**Scenario:** You are strategy manager of the region's 2nd largest retailer. Two largest competitors merge to create an entity larger than you.
**Question:** Which potential impact is the **most important** to determine to formulate a suitable response?

**Selected Answer:**
> "Reduction in your company’s pricing power and market share"

**Reasoning:**
*   **Strategic Priority:** A merger of larger competitors creates "Economies of Scale" for them, likely allowing them to lower prices. If they lower prices, you lose **Pricing Power** and subsequently **Market Share**. This is the fundamental strategic threat to your business model. Other factors (Employee count, specific regions) are secondary to this core commercial threat.

### Question 7: Bottled Water Profit Margin
**Scenario:**
*   **My Company:** Price = 100. Margin = 10%.
*   **Competitor:** Price is 10% Lower. Cost is 20% Lower.
**Question:** What is your competitors’ profit margin?

**Calculation:**
1.  **My Cost:**
    *   Margin (10%) = (Price - Cost) / Price
    *   0.10 = (100 - Cost) / 100  -> Cost = **90**.
2.  **Competitor Stats:**
    *   Price = 100 - 10% = **90**.
    *   Cost = 90 - 20% = **72**.
3.  **Competitor Margin:**
    *   Profit = 90 - 72 = 18.
    *   Margin = 18 / 90 = 0.20 = **20%**.

**Selected Answer:**
> "20%"
