# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: TASEC Group (Diversified Services).
- **Role**: Business Manager.
- **Core Function**: Revenue Generation + Operations Management.
- **Salary**: 75k - 200k (Good range, fits your 100k target).

## Match Assessment: 8/10 ✅ Strong Fit

### The Bridge: From "BD Officer" to "Business Manager"
1.  **Revenue Focus:** The #1 responsibility is "Drive revenue growth". You have done this for 5 years at Ngao/Tenakata/Kwendo. You are a *revenue generator*.
2.  **Operations:** They want "Day-to-day operations". Your role as strictly "Field Lead" or "Team Leader" at Kwendo covers this. You managed people, logistics, and targets.
3.  **Cross-Sector:** TASEC is diversified. Your background in *Microfinance* (SME), *Tech* (Tenakata/Kwendo), and *sales* makes you versatile.
4.  **Experience:** They ask for 5 years. You have exactly 5 years.

### The Strategy: "The Commercial Operator"
-   **Resume Tweak:** We will emphasize "P&L Responsibility" (managing budgets/targets) and "Strategy Implementation".
-   **Title:** We will position your past roles not just as "Sales" but as "Business Management" of your territory/portfolio.

## Recommendation

> ✅ **Apply (High Priority)**
> 
> This role fits your experience level perfectly and offers the "Manager" title you are ready for. The salary range is also right where you want to be.
