# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: Diversified Services
*Revenue, Efficiency, Growth.*
-   **The Role:** It's a "Mini-CEO" of a unit. You worry about Money Coming In (Sales) and Work Getting Done (Ops).
-   **TASEC:** Diversified (Real Estate, Tech, Consulting). Show you can handle variety.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. Driving Revenue
**Question:** "How have you driven revenue growth in your past roles?"
**Answer:** "At Kwendo, I analyzed our territory data and realized we were under-penetrating the Central region. I proposed a targeted campaign, re-allocated 3 agents there, and personally managed the key accounts. This resulted in a **20% revenue uplift** in Q1 without increasing our overall budget."

### 2. Operational Efficiency
**Question:** "How do you handle a team that is missing targets?"
**Answer:** "I diagnose the root cause first. Is it **Skill** (training needed) or **Will** (motivation)?
1.  **Analyze Data:** Look at their activity logs (calls/visits).
2.  **Shadowing:** go to the field *with* them to see their pitch.
3.  **Action Plan:** Set a 2-week Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with daily check-ins."

### 3. Client Negotiation
**Question:** "Tell me about a difficult contract negotiation."
**Answer:** "I had a corporate client at Ngao Credit who wanted a lower interest rate than our policy allowed. Instead of saying 'No', I negotiated on the *term* length and processing fees. I showed them that by paying faster, they save more than the rate cut would give them. We signed the deal, and they became a repeat client."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "Which business sector (Real Estate, Tech, etc.) will this role primarily focus on, or is it cross-cutting?"
2.  "What are the top 3 KPIs for this role in the first 90 days?"
3.  "Does TASEC have a CRM system in place for managing client interactions across the different business lines?"
