## Match Assessment: 8/10 ✅ Strong Match (Transferable)

### Strengths (Why you fit)

| JD Requirement | Your Experience | Match |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Team Leadership (1+ yr)** | Managed 50+ partner groups at My-Credit; Lead sales teams at Kwendo. | ✅ Strong |
| **Coaching & Mentoring** | "Trained staff on underwriting", "Mentored junior sales agents". | ✅ Direct |

| **Shift/High-Volume Env** | Sales is high volume; experience managing field teams. | ✅ Adaptable |
| **Problem Solving** | "Resolve operational bottlenecks" (Kwendo). | ✅ Direct |

### Potential Gaps (What to Address)

| Requirement | Analysis | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Inbound CS specific exp** | Your background is mostly *Sales* / *Outbound*. | Frame "Sales Support" and "Client Relationships" as CS excellence. |
| **Workforce Management Tools** | Mostly used Sales CRMs. | Highlight generic CRM proficiency and ability to learn. |
| **Shift Management** | Sales is usually standard hours. | Emphasize flexibility and "Field Activations" (often weekends). |

### Key Strategy
This represents a **pivot from Sales to Customer Success/Service Leadership**.
- **Pivot Narrative:** "I have spent years selling to customers; I know exactly what they need and what pains them. Now I want to lead the teams that *keep* them."
- **Leadership Focus:** Emphasize your ability to manage *people* and *performance*, regardless of whether it's sales or service KPIs.
- **ISP/Tech:** Highlight experience with Kwendo (Fintech) and understanding of digital products.

## Recommendation

> ✅ **Strong Pivot Opportunity**
> 
> You have the **Leadership** experience they need (managing 5-12 people is easy compared to your 50+ partners).
> The challenge is proving you understand the *Contact Center* mechanics (Queues, SLAs, First Contact Resolution).
> **Action:** Tailor resume to swap "Sales Targets" with "Service Levels" and "Client Retention".
