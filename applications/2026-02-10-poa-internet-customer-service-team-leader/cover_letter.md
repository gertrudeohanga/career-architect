Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Customer Service Team Leader** position at Poa! Internet. As a long-time admirer of Poa!’s mission to provide "Internet in every home in Africa," I see a unique opportunity to apply my five years of operational leadership and team coaching experience to help you deliver on the promise of "Tujienjoy kazini" and customer obsession.

While my background is rooted in Business Development, my success has always been built on **Service Excellence** and **Team Leadership**.

**Why I am the leader you need:**

1.  **Proven Team Leadership:** At My-Credit Limited, I didn't just manage a small team; I oversaw operations for a portfolio of over 50 partner groups. I know how to lead daily briefings, monitor performance dashboards, and rally a team to hit targets in a high-pressure environment. I can manage shifts, handle attendance, and keep morale high.

2.  **Coaching & Development:** I believe that a team is only as good as its training. At Kwendo, I have been responsible for onboarding new staff and conducting regular coaching sessions to close performance gaps. I know how to sit side-by-side with an agent, identify a weakness, and turn it into a strength.

3.  **Handling Escalations:** In the financial services sector, an upset customer is a high-risk situation. I have extensive experience de-escalating complex disputes involving money and contracts. I can bring this same calm, empathetic problem-solving to resolving internet service issues.

**Operational Agility:**
I am comfortable with the digital tools required for the role (CRM, Workforce Management) and am fully flexible to work ensuring coverage during evenings, weekends, and holidays as required.

I am eager to bring my energy, my "Name it, own it, solve it" attitude, and my leadership experience to the Poa! Internet team. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
