## Company Research

- **Mission:** "Internet in every home in Africa."
- **Values (We CONNECT):**
    - **C**reate a better world.
    - **O**pen our eyes.
    - **N**ever stop learning.
    - **N**ame it, own it, solve it (Accountability).

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. Leadership Style
**Question:** "How do you handle an underperforming agent?"
**Answer:** "I believe in 'Coach, don't just Scold.' First, I check if it's a **Skill** issue (training needed) or a **Will** issue (motivation). I would sit with them, listen to a call/review a chat together, and agree on *one* specific thing to fix by tomorrow. I follow up. If there's no improvement, then we move to formal performance management."

### 2. Handling Escalations
**Question:** "A customer is screaming because their internet has been down for 3 days. What do you do?"
**Answer:** "First, **Empathize** without making excuses. 'I can hear how frustrating this is, especially after 3 days.' Second, **Ownership**. 'I am taking over this case personally.' Third, **Action**. I will check the technical status immediately and give them a *honest* timeline, not a fake promise. I will call them back within the hour to update them."

### 3. Culture Fit ("Tujienjoy kazini")
**Question:** "What does 'Tujienjoy kazini' mean to you as a leader?"
**Answer:** "It means creating an environment where the team actually enjoys coming to work. Customer Service is stressful. As a leader, it's my job to keep the energy up, celebrate the small wins (like a great customer review), and ensure my team feels supported, not just monitored."

### 4. Operational Metrics
**Question:** "What KPIs would you track?"
**Answer:**
- **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score):** Are they happy?
- **FCR (First Contact Resolution):** Did we fix it once?
- **AHT (Average Handling Time):** Are we efficient?
- **SLA Adherence:** Did we answer on time?

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "With the rapid expansion to over 150 networks, what is the biggest challenge the current CS team is facing scaling up?"
2.  "How does the CS team collaborate with the Technical teams to reduce repeat tickets?"
3.  "What is the typical career path for a high-performing Team Leader at Poa!?"
