# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Anonymous (Likely SME or Mid-sized firm).
- **Role**: HR & Admin Assistant.
- **Core Function**: HR Operations, Recruitment, Admin.

## Match Assessment: 6/10 ⚠️ Functional Pivot

### The Gap
1.  **Core Function:** You are a **Sales/BD Professional**. This is an **HR/Admin** role.
2.  **Technicals:** You lack specific experience in *Payroll*, *Employment Contracts*, or *Labour Laws*.
3.  **HRIS:** You haven't used formal HRIS software (though CRM is similar).

### The Bridge (Transferable Skills)
To win this, we must reframe your "Team Leadership" as "HR Admin":
-   **Recruitment:** You recruited *Sales Agents* and *Sub-Agents*. That counts.
-   **Onboarding:** You trained new staff at Kwendo/Ngao. That counts.
-   **Records:** You managed client files (KYC). Employee files are similar.
-   **Discipline:** You managed agent performance.
-   **Degree:** BA Gender & Development covers "Social Science" and "People Management" concepts.

## Recommendation

> ⚠️ **Proceed (Pivot Application)**
> 
> This is a good "Admin" pivot.
> **Strategy:** Position yourself as an **"Operations & People Admin"** rather than a pure HR specialist. Emphasize the *coordination* and *record-keeping* aspects of your past roles.
