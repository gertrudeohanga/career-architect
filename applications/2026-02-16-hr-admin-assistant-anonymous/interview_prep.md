# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: HR Admin

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The Pivot (Why HR?)
**Question:** "You have been in Sales/BD for 5 years. Why do you want to be an HR Assistant now?"
**Answer:** "Throughout my career, the part I enjoyed most was **Team Management**—hiring, training, and organizing my team. I realized my strengths are in *People Operations* and *Administration*. I have the soft skills (empathy, communication) and the hard discipline (reporting, records) to succeed in HR."

### 2. Recruitment Coordination
**Question:** "How would you handle scheduling interviews for 50 candidates?"
**Answer:** "Organization is key.
1.  **Tracker:** I’d create an Excel tracker.
2.  **Communication:** Send clear email invites with maps/links.
3.  **Confirmations:** Call 24 hours before to confirm attendance (reduces no-shows).
4.  **Packets:** Have CVs printed and ready for the interview panel."

### 3. Confidentiality
**Question:** "You see a payroll file that shows a colleague earns more than you. What do you do?"
**Answer:** "I do nothing. In HR, I am a custodian of sensitive data. What I see in the files stays in the files. I maintain strict professional confidentiality."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What HRIS system does the company currently use?"
2.  "Is the current focus more on **Recruitment** (growth) or **Compliance** (policy)?"
3.  "Does the company offer support for professional HR certification (CHRP)?"
