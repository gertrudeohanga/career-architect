Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the HR & Admin Assistant
position. With a Bachelor’s degree in Gender and Development and over 5
years of operational leadership experience, I have developed the
organizational discipline and people-management skills required to
support your HR department.

While my background includes significant commercial experience, my daily
responsibilities have always been deeply rooted in Administration and
Team Management.

Why I am a strong candidate for this role:

1. Recruitment & Onboarding Experience: At Kwendo and Ngao Credit, I
directly supported the expansion of our field teams. I coordinated the
recruitment process for over 20 agents, handling shortlisting, interview
scheduling, and conducting the initial induction training. I understand
the importance of a structured onboarding process to ensure new staff
settle in quickly.

2. Records & Administration: I am naturally organized. I have managed
complex record-keeping systems for client KYCs and staff attendance
logs. I understand that in HR, accuracy and confidentiality are
non-negotiable. I am proficient in digital tools (MS Office/CRM) and can
easily adapt to your HRIS software.

3. Employee Relations & Compliance: Having led teams, I have experience
handling first-level disciplinary issues, monitoring probation
performance, and ensuring team cohesion. My academic background in
Gender and Development gives me a strong foundation in understanding
workplace dynamics and inclusivity.

I am eager to pivot my career fully into Human Resources and
Administration, bringing my proactive “get-it-done” attitude to your
team.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
