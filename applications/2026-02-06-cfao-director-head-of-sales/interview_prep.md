# Interview Preparation

## Company Research
- **Name:** CFAO Mobility (Toyota Tsusho Corp).
- **Brand:** BYD (Build Your Dreams) - World's largest EV manufacturer.
- **Context:** CFAO is the distributor. BYD is the product.
- **Market:** EVs are new in Kenya. Main buyers are Corporate Fleets (ESG goals) and Taxi apps (Lower running costs).

## The "Elephant in the Room"
**They will ask:** "You have no automotive experience. Why should we hire you as Director?"
**Your Strategy:** Do not apologize. Pivot to **Sales Fundamentals**.
*Answer:* "Cars, like financial products, are high-value assets sold on trust and utility. I bring:
1.  **Sales Discipline:** The process of prospecting, qualifying, and closing is universal.
2.  **Credit Expertise:** Most cars are bought on finance. I know exactly how banks think and how to structure deals so they get approved.
3.  **Fresh Energy:** I don't have 'bad habits' from the legacy auto industry. I am ready to sell the *future* (EVs), not the past."

## Likely Interview Questions

### Strategy
**Q: "How will you launch the BYD brand in Kenya?"**
*Answer:*
1.  **Taget the Fleets:** "Uber/Bolt drivers and Corporate Fleets maximize the fuel savings immediately. I would start B2B."
2.  **Experience Centers:** "People need to *feel* the acceleration. I would organize 'Test Drive Days' at corporate parks."
3.  **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** "I wouldn't sell the price tag; I'd sell the savings per kilometer."

### Leadership
**Q: "How do you manage a sales team?"**
*Answer:* "I lead from the front.
- **Clear KPIs:** Calls, Visits, Test Drives, Offers.
- **Weekly Cadence:** Monday pipeline review, Friday wins celebration.
- **Coaching:** I go to the field with them. If they fail, I fail."

### Operations
**Q: "How do you handle inventory?"**
*Answer:* "Inventory is cash sitting on the floor. I would work closely with marketing to ensure we are moving units First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and offering incentives on aging stock to keep liquidity moving."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the current charging infrastructure support that CFAO offers to BYD buyers?"
2.  "Is the sales focus primarily Retail (individuals) or B2B (Fleets)?"
3.  "What is the biggest objection you are currently hearing from customers about EVs?"
