Dear Hiring Committee,

The introduction of BYD to the Kenyan market represents a pivotal moment
in the automotive industry, and establishing it as the market leader
requires more than just industry experience—it demands energy, strategic
agility, and a relentless focus on sales execution. I am writing to
apply for the Director / Head of Sales position with the confidence that
my background in high-growth sales leadership and asset finance
positions me to drive this revolution.

While my career has been rooted in the financial services sector, the
parallels to the automotive industry—specifically within asset-backed
sales—are significant. At My-Credit Limited and Ngao Credit, I did not
just sell “loans”; I sold the capability for assets to transform
businesses and lives. I managed networks of over 50 dealer groups,
understanding the intricacies of credit management, inventory turnover,
and the critical importance of minimizing bad debt. These are the same
commercial pillars required to manage a successful vehicle sales
operation.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I
successfully entered a competitive B2B market and acquired over 100
corporate clients in under six months. This demonstrates my ability to
take a new value proposition, identify the “early adopters,” and close
deals rapidly. I bring a “hunter” mentality to sales leadership—I don’t
just manage dashboards; I accompany my teams to the field, coach on live
deals, and lead by example.

I possess the strong leadership and strategic agility required to build
the BYD brand from the ground up. I understand that selling EVs in Kenya
is an educational sale as much as a commercial one. My experience in
consultative selling and market education ensures I can articulate the
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) benefits of BYD to skeptical fleet
managers and individual buyers alike.

I am ready to bring my discipline, sales rigor, and fresh perspective to
CFAO Mobility. I welcome the challenge of exceeding your sales targets
and establishing BYD as the premier EV brand in the region.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
