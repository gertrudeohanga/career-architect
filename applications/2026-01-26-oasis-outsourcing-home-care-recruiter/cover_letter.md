Hiring Manager
Oasis Outsourcing
Nairobi, Kenya

**Subject: Application for Home Care Recruiter Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Home Care Recruiter position at Oasis Outsourcing. With over 7 years of experience in candidate assessment, relationship management, and program coordination, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your mission of connecting compassionate caregivers with clients who need quality home care services.

Throughout my career, I have developed strong skills in candidate evaluation and interviewing. At Laterite Kenya Limited, I conducted interviews with refugee populations assessing program effectiveness and individual needs, while at Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, I evaluated community members for program eligibility and funding support. This experience has equipped me with the ability to assess qualifications, evaluate cultural fit, and make informed decisions about candidate suitability.

My relationship management experience is directly relevant to recruitment. At Schmsoft Ventures, I built and maintained relationships with over 200 clients, developing comprehensive needs assessment frameworks that helped me understand their requirements and recommend tailored solutions. This same approach would be valuable in understanding hiring manager needs and finding candidates who align with your home care mission.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of Oasis Outsourcing's commitment to meaningful work that impacts lives every day. My background in community development and social services has always been driven by a desire to make a positive difference. Whether supporting vulnerable populations through food assistance programs or helping communities access government services, I have consistently focused on work that creates real impact.

My organizational and compliance skills are well-suited for the fast-paced recruitment environment. I have experience maintaining accurate documentation, ensuring regulatory compliance, and managing multiple priorities effectively. My proficiency in Microsoft Office and experience with database systems will help me quickly adapt to your ATS and HR processes.

I am available for full on-site work and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my recruitment skills, relationship management experience, and passion for mission-driven work can help Oasis Outsourcing continue to hire exceptional home care professionals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
