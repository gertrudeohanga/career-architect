Subject: Application for Home Care Recruiter Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Home Care Recruiter position at Oasis Outsourcing. With 5+ years of experience in candidate assessment, relationship management, and program coordination, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your mission of connecting compassionate caregivers with clients needing quality home care services.

My experience includes conducting interviews with diverse populations, evaluating qualifications, and assessing cultural fit. At Laterite Kenya Limited, I conducted interviews assessing program effectiveness, while at Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, I evaluated community members for program eligibility. This has equipped me with strong candidate assessment skills directly applicable to home care recruitment.

At Schmsoft Ventures, I built relationships with 200+ clients, developing needs assessment frameworks that helped understand requirements and recommend solutions. This approach would be valuable in understanding hiring manager needs and finding candidates aligned with your home care mission.

I am particularly drawn to Oasis Outsourcing's commitment to meaningful work that impacts lives daily. My background in community development has always focused on creating positive impact, which aligns perfectly with healthcare recruitment.

I am available for full on-site work and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my recruitment skills and passion for mission-driven work can help Oasis Outsourcing continue to hire exceptional home care professionals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
