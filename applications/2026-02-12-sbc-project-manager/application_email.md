# Application Submission Guide

## Appication Method
-   **Method:** "Apply Now" (Online - likely via a portal or email).
-   **Deadline:** Posted 9 hours ago (Early application is good!).

## Critical Checklist

### 1. The "PM" Language
-   Your resume has been rewritten to use PM keywords: **Portfolio**, **Lifecycle**, **Deliverables**, **Scope**, **Stakeholders**.
-   Ensure you stick to this language in any form fields.

### 2. Writing Samples
-   They emphasize "Exceptional writing skills".
-   If asked for samples, you can mention: "Internal Impact Reports", "Partnership Proposals", "Training Manuals".
-   ensure your Cover Letter is **perfectly proofread**. It is your first writing sample.

### 3. Salary
-   Range: **50k - 100k**.
-   Recommendation: **80,000 - 90,000**. (This sits comfortably in the upper half but leaves room for the fact that you don't have a Master's).

## Messaging
