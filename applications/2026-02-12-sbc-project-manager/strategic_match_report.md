# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: SBC Limited (Likely a consulting or development firm given the "Donor Reports" mention).
- **Role**: Project Manager.
- **Salary**: 50k - 100k.
- **Key Focus**: Writing, Business Concepts, Project Execution.

## Match Assessment: 6/10 ⚠️ Good Fit, Educational Gap

### Strengths (Why you fit)
| JD Requirement | Your Experience | Match |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Business Development** | Core strength (Kwendo, My-Credit). You source opportunities and develop concepts. | ✅ Strong |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Managed relationships with 50+ partners and C-level execs. | ✅ Strong |
| **Reporting/Writing** | "Generated weekly sales and activity reports" (Schmsoft). BA Degree involved research. | ✅ Moderate |
| **Project Leadership** | Launched new markets (Tenakata/Kwendo). This *is* project management. | ✅ Transferable |

### The Gaps
| Requirement | Analysis | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Master's Degree** | JD asks for Masters. You have a BA. | The salary range (50k-100k) suggests they might accept experience over education. We highlight "Proven Track Record". |
| **Donor/Whitepaper Writing** | Have you written *Donor* reports formally? | Frame your "Impact Reporting" at Tenakata/Kwendo as donor-grade reporting. |
| **PMP/PRINCE2** | "Plus", not mandatory. | Highlight "Agile" or "Practical Project Management". |

### Key Strategy
**"The Commercial Project Manager"**
-   Instead of a pure "Certified PM" (who just tracks charts), position yourself as a **Commercial PM** who drives *Business Results* (Revenue/Growth).
-   **Pivot:** Frame your "Business Development" work as "Project Management". (e.g., "Managed the *Project* of expanding to Central Region").
-   **Writing:** Emphasize your ability to write "Proposals" and "Concept Notes".

## Recommendation

> ✅ **Submit**
> 
> The salary fits your range. The Master's requirement is likely a "wish list" item for this salary band. Your practical experience in driving initiatives matches the "Portfolio Management" need. 
> **Action:** Tailor resume to use PM terminology (Lifecycle, Scope, Deliverables).
