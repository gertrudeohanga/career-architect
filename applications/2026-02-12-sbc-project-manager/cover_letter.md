Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Project Manager** position at SBC Limited. With over five years of experience managing portfolios, leading market expansion initiatives, and developing business concepts in the Fintech sector, I bring the "Commercial Project Management" skillset necessary to drive your profit and non-profit initiatives forward.

While my title has often been "Business Development," my day-to-day work is **Project Management**. I take an idea (Scope), secure the resources (Budget), and manage the team to deliver it (Timeline).

**Why I am the right fit:**

**1. Documentation & Report Writing:**
I understand that a project is only as good as its documentation. Throughout my career at Kwendo and Schmsoft, I have been responsible for drafting detailed proposals, concept notes, and impact reports. My background in Gender and Development provided me with rigorous training in social research and report writing, which I have applied to corporate reporting, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and professional tone.

**2. Concept Development & Business Development:**
Your JD highlights the need to "source for new opportunities." This is my core strength. I have successfully developed and executed Go-to-Market concepts that resulted in a 25% increase in active accounts. I don't just manage existing projects; I help create new ones by identifying market gaps and drafting winning proposals.

**3. Portfolio Management:**
At My-Credit Limited, I managed a portfolio of over **50 partner groups**. This required juggling multiple timelines, diverse stakeholder expectations, and strict financial constraints simultaneously. I have a proven track record of maintaining quality assurance across a complex portfolio while ensuring financial objectives are met.

I am eager to bring my analytical skills, my leadership experience, and my commitment to high-quality delivery to SBC Limited.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
