# Interview Preparation

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The "Project Manager" Title
**Question:** "Your resume says Business Development. Do you have formal PM experience?"
**Answer:** "In my view, Business Development *is* Project Management. Every market expansion I led was a project: it had a start date, an end date, a budget, and deliverables. For example, at Kwendo, launching the Central Region required a detailed project plan, stakeholder mapping, and weekly risk reporting. I use the PM methodology (Initiate, Plan, Execute, Monitor, Close) intuitively to drive results."

### 2. Report Writing & Documentation
**Question:** "Give me an example of a complex report you wrote."
**Answer:** "At Tenakata, I authored the 'Impact Assessment Report' for our MSME digitization program. It involved synthesizing data from 300+ clients, analyzing adoption trends using Excel, and writing a narrative summary for our leadership team. I focused on clear data visualization and actionable recommendations."

### 3. Concept Development
**Question:** "How do you develop a new concept?"
**Answer:** "I start with the **Problem Statement**. What are we solving?
1.  **Research:** I gather data (Market/Client feedback).
2.  **Drafting:** I write a 'Concept Note' outlining the solution, the budget, and the expected ROI.
3.  **Review:** I present it to stakeholders for feedback before full proposal development."

### 4. Managing Stakeholders
**Question:** "How do you handle a stakeholder who delays the project?"
**Answer:** "Communication is key. I maintain a 'Risk Log'. If a stakeholder is delaying, I flag it early—not as a complaint, but as a risk to the timeline. 'If we don't get approval by Friday, the launch moves to next month.' I focus on the impact of the delay to create urgency."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "For the 'Non-Profit' lines of business, who are the primary donors or partners we report to?"
2.  "What is the typical lifecycle of a project at SBC—are they short-term (3 months) or multi-year initiatives?"
3.  "Is the current priority to stabilize the current portfolio or to aggressively expand into new concepts?"
