Dear Hiring Manager,

With over five years of experience in field sales, dealer management, and corporate sales, I am writing to apply for the Field Sales Officer position. My proven track record of exceeding sales targets, managing dealer networks, and gathering market intelligence aligns well with this role's requirements, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Honda's market expansion in Kenya.

In my current role at Kwendo, I manage over 100 business client relationships, conduct field sales across my territory, and gather competitive intelligence to inform sales strategies. At My-Credit Limited, I achieved 120% of annual sales targets while recruiting and managing 50+ dealer/agent groups, monitoring their stock movement, and negotiating to increase wholesale volumes. I proposed and implemented marketing strategies that expanded our market share, and I delivered all this while working independently with minimal supervision.

While my background is in financial services rather than motorcycles, the core competencies—dealer support, territory management, corporate sales, market intelligence, and reporting—are directly transferable. I am a fast learner who adapts quickly to new industries, and I am willing to work anywhere in the country to support Honda's dealer network and expand market share. My experience closing corporate deals and developing new dealers makes me well-suited to contribute immediately to your wholesale and retail sales objectives.

I look forward to discussing how my proven field sales results can contribute to Honda Motorcycle Kenya's growth. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
