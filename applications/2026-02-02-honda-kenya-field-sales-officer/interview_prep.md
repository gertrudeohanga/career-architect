## Likely Interview Questions

### Sales Experience

**Q1: Tell us about your field sales experience.**

*STAR Answer:*
- **Situation:** At My-Credit, I was assigned a territory to develop
- **Task:** Recruit dealers, manage their performance, and achieve sales targets
- **Action:** Conducted field visits, monitored dealer stock movement, negotiated wholesale volumes, and provided sales support through activations
- **Result:** Achieved 120% of targets while managing 50+ dealer/agent groups

**Q2: How do you support dealers to increase their sales?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I take a hands-on approach. First, I understand each dealer's situation—their challenges, their market, their capacity. Then I help them with specific actions: joint marketing activities, product training, identifying customer opportunities, resolving issues quickly. At My-Credit, I would visit dealers regularly, review their stock movement, and brainstorm ways to increase their sell-through. The key is being a partner, not just a salesperson."

**Q3: How would you approach corporate sales?**

*Sample Answer:*
"Corporate sales require understanding the client's business needs. I'd identify companies that use motorcycles—courier services, delivery companies, field service businesses. Then I'd approach decision-makers with a tailored proposal showing the value of Honda: reliability, service network, resale value. At Kwendo, I've acquired 100+ B2B clients by focusing on their specific needs rather than generic pitches."

### Industry Knowledge

**Q4: Why are you interested in the motorcycle industry?**

*Sample Answer:*
"The motorcycle industry in Kenya is dynamic and growing. Boda-boda is a major part of our economy, and Honda has a strong reputation for quality. While my background is in financial services, the sales fundamentals—dealer management, territory development, corporate sales—are the same. I'm excited to apply my proven skills in a new industry and learn the motorcycle business quickly."

**Q5: How would you gather market intelligence?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'd use multiple sources: conversations with dealers about competitor pricing and promotions, observing what's selling in the market, talking to mechanics about common issues, monitoring competitor activities. I'd document everything and provide regular reports. Market intelligence is about having my eyes and ears open during every field visit."

### Work Style

**Q6: Can you work with minimal supervision?**

*Sample Answer:*
"Absolutely. Most of my roles have been field-based where I set my own schedule and plan my own activities. At My-Credit, I managed my territory independently, meeting all targets and reporting requirements. I'm disciplined about planning, execution, and communication—my supervisors always know what I'm doing without having to check on me."
