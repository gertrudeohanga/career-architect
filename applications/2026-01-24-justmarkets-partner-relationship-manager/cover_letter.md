## Application for Partner Relationship Manager Position

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Partner Relationship Manager position at JustMarkets for West Africa operations. With 5+ years of proven expertise in partnership development, relationship management, and business growth in the financial services sector, I am confident I can drive JustMarkets' partnership pipeline and expansion across the West African market.

### Why I'm an Ideal Fit

**Proven Partnership Development Track Record**

My career has been built on developing and managing high-value partnerships in financial services. At Ngao Credit Limited and My-Credit Limited, I developed strong relationships with diverse partners, managing the complete partnership lifecycle from acquisition through successful execution. At Schmsoft Ventures, I maintained strategic partnerships while providing commercial guidance supporting partner growth. I understand the entire partnership journey—identifying opportunities, onboarding partners, ensuring their success, and expanding relationships—which aligns perfectly with JustMarkets' requirements.

**Financial Services Expertise & Regulatory Compliance Mastery**

I bring deep expertise in the financial services regulatory environment. At the Ministry of Youth and Gender Affairs, I managed government loan program partnerships, ensuring 100% compliance with regulatory requirements across multiple partner groups. This experience has equipped me with comprehensive knowledge of financial services regulatory frameworks, partner compliance standards, and risk management—essential for protecting JustMarkets' brand while enabling partner growth.

**Business Development & Sales Success**

I have a proven track record of driving business growth and exceeding targets. In each role, I've successfully identified new partnership opportunities, converted them into productive relationships, and supported partner expansion. My commercial acumen—developed through evaluating business viability, assessing partnership potential, and recommending growth strategies—ensures I'll identify partnerships that drive mutual success.

**Multi-Stakeholder Relationship Management**

My experience coordinating with government agencies, development partners (World Food Programme), NGOs, and private organizations demonstrates my ability to build and maintain relationships across diverse stakeholders—critical for managing JustMarkets' diverse partner ecosystem. I excel at understanding different stakeholder priorities, addressing their needs, and ensuring all parties achieve their objectives.

**Commitment to Partner Success & Retention**

I'm not just focused on acquiring partners; I'm committed to their success and retention. Throughout my career, I've provided strategic support helping partners reach their business objectives, resolved issues promptly, and maintained long-term relationships. This approach drives loyalty, repeat business, and partnership expansion—the hallmark of successful partnership management.

### Why JustMarkets & West Africa

JustMarkets' commitment to partnership-driven growth in West Africa's dynamic financial services market is compelling. The region's growth potential combined with the opportunity to build JustMarkets' partnership network aligns with my professional goals. I bring not only financial services expertise but also multilingual capability (English + Swahili with commitment to French) and experience working across diverse cultural and regulatory contexts.

### What I'll Deliver

I commit to:
* Strategic partnership acquisition exceeding quarterly targets
* 100% partner compliance with regulatory and brand standards
* High partner satisfaction through excellent relationship management and issue resolution
* Successful partner retention and expansion of existing relationships
* Market insights and strategic recommendations driving JustMarkets' growth in West Africa

### A Quick Note on Geography

While I'm based in Kenya, I bring extensive experience operating across diverse markets with different regulatory environments—a skill directly applicable to West African operations. I'm committed to learning French and Portuguese to enhance market effectiveness, and I'm fully prepared for occasional travel to support partner success.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven partnership development expertise, financial services knowledge, and commitment to partner success can help JustMarkets drive growth and establish strong market presence in West Africa.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you.
