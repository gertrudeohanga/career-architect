Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Partner Relationship Manager position for JustMarkets' West Africa operations.

With 5+ years of proven expertise in partnership development, business growth, and stakeholder management in the financial services sector, I am confident I can drive JustMarkets' partnership pipeline and market expansion across West Africa. My experience managing partnerships at Ngao Credit Limited, My-Credit Limited, and Schmsoft Ventures has equipped me with deep knowledge of partnership acquisition, relationship management, and partner success—the core requirements for this role.

As detailed in my attached resume and cover letter, I bring:

* **5+ years of financial services partnership expertise** - Direct experience acquiring, onboarding, and managing high-value partnerships
* **Proven business development success** - Track record of driving revenue growth and exceeding targets
* **Regulatory compliance mastery** - Deep knowledge of financial services regulatory frameworks and partner compliance management
* **Multi-stakeholder coordination** - Extensive experience working with government agencies, development partners, and NGOs
* **Multilingual capability** - English and Swahili fluency with commitment to learning French and Portuguese for West Africa operations

I am genuinely excited by the opportunity to build JustMarkets' partnership network in West Africa's dynamic financial services market. I'm prepared for relocation, occasional travel, and the challenge of establishing strong market presence.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my partnership development expertise and financial services knowledge can help JustMarkets drive growth and succeed in West Africa.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you.
