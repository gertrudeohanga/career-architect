Hiring Manager
The Action Foundation
Nairobi, Kenya

Subject: Application for People & Culture Associate Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the People & Culture Associate position at The Action Foundation. With 5+ years of experience in stakeholder engagement, relationship management, and program coordination, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your mission of championing disability-inclusive service delivery.

My experience includes building relationships with 200+ clients at Schmsoft Ventures, conducting interviews with diverse populations at Laterite Kenya, and managing compliance documentation at Tenakata Enterprise. These roles have equipped me with strong people management, assessment, and documentation skills directly applicable to HR functions.

I am particularly drawn to The Action Foundation because of my deep commitment to social impact and inclusion. My work with Maendeleo Ya Wanawake focused on advocacy for human rights, while my experience with the Ministry of Youth involved programs for vulnerable populations. I understand the importance of creating inclusive environments and am passionate about supporting organizational cultures that empower individuals with disabilities.

I am immediately available and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my people management skills, assessment experience, and passion for social impact can support your HR functions and contribute to your inclusive organizational culture.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
