Hiring Manager
The Action Foundation
Nairobi, Kenya

**Subject: Application for People & Culture Associate Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the People & Culture Associate position at The Action Foundation. With over 5 years of experience in stakeholder engagement, relationship management, and program coordination, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your mission of championing disability-inclusive service delivery and creating pathways for Children and Youth with Disabilities to reach their full potential.

Throughout my career, I have developed strong skills in people management and assessment. At Schmsoft Ventures, I built and maintained relationships with over 200 clients, developing comprehensive needs assessment frameworks that helped me understand their requirements and recommend tailored solutions. This experience has equipped me with the ability to serve as an effective first point of contact for staff queries and to manage employee relations with professionalism and empathy.

My background in recruitment and assessment aligns well with the talent acquisition aspects of this role. At Laterite Kenya Limited, I conducted interviews with refugee populations assessing program effectiveness and individual needs, while at Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, I evaluated community members for program eligibility and funding support. This experience has given me strong skills in candidate evaluation, interview coordination, and assessment processes that are directly applicable to recruitment functions.

I am particularly drawn to The Action Foundation because of my deep commitment to social impact and inclusion. My work with Maendeleo Ya Wanawake focused on advocacy for gender equality and human rights, while my experience with the Ministry of Youth involved implementing programs for vulnerable populations. I understand the importance of creating inclusive environments and am passionate about supporting organizational cultures that empower individuals with disabilities.

My compliance and documentation experience is well-suited for the HR policy and data management aspects of this role. At Tenakata Enterprise, I ensured 100% compliance with regulatory reporting requirements, and at Ngao Credit, I maintained accurate CRM records supporting compliance needs. I have strong attention to detail and maintain high levels of integrity and confidentiality when handling sensitive information.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my people management skills, assessment experience, and passion for social impact to The Action Foundation. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in stakeholder engagement, program coordination, and mission-driven work can support your HR functions and contribute to your inclusive organizational culture.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
