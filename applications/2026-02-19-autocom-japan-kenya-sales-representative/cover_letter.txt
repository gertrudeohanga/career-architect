Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Sales Representative position at Autocom
Japan Kenya Ltd. With over five years of proven success in high-value
asset sales and client relationship management, I have consistently
exceeded monthly sales targets through systematic lead generation and
relationship-building strategies. My experience selling logbook loans at
Ngao Credit Limited directly parallels vehicle sales—both require
trust-building with clients making major purchases, technical product
knowledge, needs assessment, and long-term relationship management. I am
confident I can drive revenue growth for Autocom’s Japanese vehicle
import business while delivering the transparent, customer-focused
service your company is known for.

At Ngao Credit Limited, I consistently exceeded monthly sales targets by
implementing effective lead generation strategies and maintaining a
robust sales pipeline. I guided over 100 clients through the complete
loan application process, from prospecting to disbursement, achieving a
30% repeat business rate through hands-on support and relationship
management. This experience taught me how to assess client needs,
explain complex financial products, negotiate terms professionally, and
build trust with customers making significant financial
commitments—skills that translate directly to selling quality vehicles
from Japan. Additionally, my current role at Kwendo has strengthened my
ability to work independently, master new platforms quickly, and provide
exceptional after-sales support that ensures customer satisfaction and
generates referrals.

What excites me most about Autocom Japan Kenya is your commitment to
delivering reliable vehicles through transparent processes and excellent
customer service. I share your belief that trust and integrity are the
foundation of successful sales relationships, particularly in markets
where customers are making major purchasing decisions. My background in
financial inclusion and community-focused service aligns perfectly with
your mission to serve both individual and corporate clients across
Kenya. I am eager to learn about vehicle specifications and the import
process, and I am confident my proven track record of quickly mastering
new products—from microfinance to digital payroll platforms—will enable
me to become a knowledgeable advocate for your inventory.

I am immediately available to start and excited about the opportunity to
contribute to Autocom’s growth trajectory. I would welcome the chance to
discuss how my sales expertise, relationship management skills, and
target-driven approach can help expand your client base in Nairobi.
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to speaking
with you soon.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
