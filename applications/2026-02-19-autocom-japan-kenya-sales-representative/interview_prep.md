## Weak Point Defense

### Potential Concern #1: Lack of Automotive Industry Experience

**Likely question**: "You don't have automotive sales experience. Why should we hire you for this role?"

**Your pivot**:
"That's a fair question. While automotive is a new sector for me, I bring proven success in high-value asset sales that directly parallels vehicle sales. At Ngao Credit, I sold logbook loans where customers used their vehicles as collateral—this required me to understand vehicle valuation, build trust with customers making major financial decisions, and provide consultative guidance through complex processes. The skills are identical: needs assessment, technical product knowledge, relationship building, and closing high-stakes deals. Additionally, I have a track record of rapidly mastering new products across fintech, microfinance, and HR-tech sectors. I'm confident I can quickly learn vehicle specifications and the import process, and I'm genuinely excited about bringing my proven sales methodology to the automotive sector."

---

### Potential Concern #2: Compensation Expectations

**Likely question**: "The base salary is quite low at USD 300. Are you comfortable with this?"

**Your pivot**:
"I understand the compensation structure is commission-heavy, and I'm confident in my ability to generate strong earnings based on my proven sales track record. At Ngao Credit, I consistently exceeded monthly targets and built a 30% repeat business rate, which demonstrates my ability to not just close deals but build relationships that generate ongoing revenue. I view the commission structure as an opportunity to directly benefit from my performance. That said, I'd like to understand more about the commission rates, average monthly earnings for successful sales representatives, and what support Autocom provides for lead generation. Can you share more about what top performers typically earn?"

**Key strategy**: Project confidence while gathering critical information about realistic earning potential

---

### Potential Concern #3: Job Hopping (Multiple Short-Term Roles)

**Likely question**: "I notice you've had several roles in the past few years. Why the frequent changes?"

**Your pivot**:
"Great question. My career progression reflects intentional growth and expanding responsibilities rather than instability. I started in microfinance sales at My-Credit Limited for two years, then moved to Ngao Credit to specialize in logbook loans—a more complex, high-value product. Most recently, I transitioned to Kwendo as a Business Development Manager, which was a significant step up into a leadership role in the HR-tech sector. Each move represented an opportunity to take on greater challenges and develop new skills. Now I'm excited about the automotive sector because it combines my sales expertise with a new industry that has strong growth potential in Kenya. I'm looking for a role where I can build long-term success, and Autocom's growth trajectory is exactly what I'm seeking."

**Key strategy**: Frame moves as intentional career progression, not instability
