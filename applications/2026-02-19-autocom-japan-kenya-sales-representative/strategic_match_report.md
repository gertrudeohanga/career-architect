1. **Proven Sales Track Record**: Consistently exceeded monthly sales targets at Ngao Credit with strong lead generation and conversion capabilities
2. **Relationship Management Excellence**: Built long-term client relationships resulting in repeat business and referrals across multiple roles
3. **High-Value Asset Sales Experience**: Logbook loan sales at Ngao Credit directly parallel vehicle sales - both require trust-building, technical product knowledge, needs assessment, and negotiation

5. **Immediate Availability**: Can start immediately as required by the role

2. **Learning Agility**: Emphasize track record of quickly mastering new products, platforms, and markets (fintech → microfinance → HR-tech → automotive)
3. **Compensation Expectations**: Address the USD 300 base salary directly - express understanding of commission-heavy structure and confidence in ability to generate strong commission income based on proven sales performance

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### Resume Strategy
- Lead with sales achievements and metrics from Ngao Credit and My-Credit Limited
- Emphasize "high-value asset sales" experience (logbook loans = vehicle sales analogy)
- Highlight CRM proficiency and digital platform adoption
- Include immediate availability prominently

### Cover Letter Strategy
- Open with enthusiasm for automotive sector and Autocom's growth trajectory
- Draw direct parallels between loan sales and vehicle sales
- Address compensation structure positively - confidence in commission earnings
- Emphasize relationship-building approach and customer service excellence

### Interview Preparation
- Research Japanese vehicle market and popular models in Kenya
- Prepare questions about commission structure and average earnings
- Demonstrate knowledge of vehicle import process basics
- Highlight examples of exceeding sales targets and building client relationships

## ⚠️ Compensation Reality Check

**Critical Note**: USD 300 base salary (approximately KES 38,700) is significantly below your current salary expectations (KES 90,000-200,000) and market rate for 2-3 years experience.

**Considerations**:
- This is a heavily commission-dependent role
- Success requires strong sales performance to generate meaningful income
- Ask about average monthly earnings including commissions during interview
- Clarify sales targets, commission structure, and lead generation support
- Consider as a stepping stone into automotive sector if long-term interest exists

**Recommendation**: Proceed with application but treat as exploratory - use interview to assess realistic earning potential and growth opportunities.
