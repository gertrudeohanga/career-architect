Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Manager - Credit
Analysis position. While my career has largely operated on the
“Origination” side of the desk, my success has been defined by my
ability to think like a Credit Analyst. In the high-risk SME and
Micro-finance sectors (My-Credit, Ngao), survival depends on rigorous
upfront analysis and proactive monitoring—skills I have mastered over
the last five years.

I am applying as a “Field-Grounded Risk Manager” who understands the
reality behind the financial statements.

Why I offer a unique perspective:

1. SME & Corporate Risk Assessment: At My-Credit Limited, I managed a
portfolio of 50+ SME borrower groups. Unlike a traditional analyst who
relies solely on audited accounts (which can be unreliable in the SME
sector), I utilized “Shadow P&L” analysis, site visits, and cash-flow
triangulation to assess true repayment capacity. This resulted in my
portfolio maintaining a PAR of <5% consistently.

2. Early Warning & Monitoring: The job description emphasizes “tracking
accounts showing early signs of deterioration.” This has been my daily
reality. I don’t wait for a missed payment; I monitor leading
indicators—inventory levels, owner behavior, market changes. I have
successfully restructured distressed facilities for clients who faced
temporary cash flow shocks, preserving the bank’s capital while
retaining the relationship.

3. Policy & Process: I have extensive experience enforcing credit
policies in fast-paced environments. At Kwendo, I act as the “First Line
of Defense,” ensuring that no deal enters the pipeline unless it meets
our strict risk acceptance criteria. I have trained junior teams on
these policies, ensuring a culture of compliance.

4. Leadership: I have supervised teams and understand the importance of
mentorship. I am ready to guide Sidian’s analysts to look beyond the
spreadsheet and understand the business they are underwriting.

I am eager to bring my practical, results-oriented risk management
approach to Sidian Bank.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
