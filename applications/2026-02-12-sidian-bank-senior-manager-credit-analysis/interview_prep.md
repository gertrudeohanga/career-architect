# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: Credit Risk
*You need to sound like an Analyst, not a Salesperson.*
-   **5 Cs of Credit:** Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, Conditions.
-   **PAR:** Portfolio at Risk.
-   **NPL:** Non-Performing Loan.
-   **DSCR:** Debt Service Coverage Ratio (Cash flow / Debt obligations). >1.2 is usually good.
-   **LTV:** Loan to Value (Loan amount / Collateral value).

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The Experience Gap (10 Years vs 5 Years)
**Question:** "This role requires 10 years and Corporate Analysis experience. You have 5 years in SMEBD. Why should we hire you?"
**Answer:** "I respect the tenure requirement. However, I believe the *intensity* of my experience makes up for the duration. In the Tier 2/Micro-finance space, I didn't have the luxury of perfectly audited accounts. I had to learn **Forensic Credit Analysis**—reconstructing financials from scratch to assess risk. I bring a 'Field Reality' to the analysis that pure desk-analysts often miss. I can spot a bad deal on the ground before it looks bad on paper."

### 2. Assessing SME Risk
**Question:** "How do you analyze an SME with no audited accounts?"
**Answer:** "I use triangulation.
1.  **Bank Statements:** I look for cash churn, not just closing balance.
2.  **Supplier Invoices:** Are they paying suppliers on time?
3.  **Site Visit:** I look at stock levels and footfall.
4.  **Shadow P&L:** I build my own income statement based on these verifiable data points to calculate the real DSCR."

### 3. Managing a Team of Analysts
**Question:** "How would you supervise analysts who might have more technical finance degrees than you?"
**Answer:** "I lead by **Context**. My analysts might be wizards at spreading spreadsheets, but I teach them the **Business Context**. I ask them: 'The numbers look good, but does the business model make sense in this economy?' I empower them to use their technical skills while I provide the strategic risk oversight."

### 4. Handling Pressure from RMs
**Question:** "A Relationship Manager is pushing for a deal you think is risky. What do you do?"
**Answer:** "I stick to the **Data**. I don't say 'No', I say 'Show me the mitigation'.
'The DSCR is 0.9. That is a fail. Unless you can show me additional collateral or a guarantor to cover that gap, I cannot approve.' I keep it professional and policy-based, not personal."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the current NPL ratio target for the Corporate book this year?"
2.  "Is the bank looking to automate more of the SME credit scoring, or is it still a manual deep-dive process?"
3.  "How is the credit team structured—by sector (e.g., Trade, Manufacturing) or simply by ticket size?"
