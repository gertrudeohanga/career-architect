**Subject: Application for Head of Customer Success - East Africa**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Head of Customer Success position at Zeno. With 7+ years building and scaling customer relationships across East Africa, I am confident in my ability to lead Zeno's customer success strategy and drive exceptional experiences for your riders and partners.

At Kwendo, I led client onboarding strategies that improved platform adoption by 40% within 6 months, developing relationship management protocols that enhanced engagement and retention. My experience spans diverse East African markets from urban centers to refugee camps, giving me unique cross-cultural competence perfect for Zeno's expansion across Kenya, Uganda, and beyond.

My approach is data-driven and operationally strong. I have extensive experience implementing CRM systems, designing NPS/CSAT metrics, and turning insights into actionable improvements. At Schmsoft Ventures, I scaled client relationships across 200+ accounts, increasing retention by 35% through tailored needs assessments and systematic follow-up processes.

What excites me most is Zeno's mission to accelerate the energy transition while democratizing benefits across Africa. My background in community development and financial inclusion has always focused on creating tangible impact through technology and innovation.

I am immediately available and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my customer success leadership experience and regional expertise can help Zeno achieve its ambitious goals across East Africa.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
