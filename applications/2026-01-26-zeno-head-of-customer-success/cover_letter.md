**Subject: Application for Head of Customer Success - East Africa**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Head of Customer Success position at Zeno. With over 7 years of experience building and scaling customer relationships across East Africa, combined with my deep passion for sustainable technology solutions, I am confident in my ability to lead Zeno's customer success strategy and drive exceptional experiences for your riders, partners, and fleet customers.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated the exact blend of customer-centric leadership, regional expertise, and operational excellence that this role demands. At Kwendo, I led client onboarding strategies that significantly improved platform adoption and user satisfaction, developing comprehensive relationship management protocols that enhanced client engagement and retention. This experience in digital platform adoption directly translates to the challenges and opportunities in Zeno's electric motorcycle ecosystem.

My regional experience spans diverse East African markets, from urban centers to refugee camps in Kakuma, Kaloboyei, and Dadaab. This cross-cultural competence has equipped me with the unique ability to understand and serve varied customer segments while ensuring consistency and cultural relevance across markets – exactly what Zeno needs as it expands across Kenya, Uganda, and beyond.

What particularly excites me about Zeno is your mission to accelerate the energy transition while democratizing benefits across Africa. My work in community development and financial inclusion has always been driven by a desire to create tangible impact in people's lives. Whether facilitating 50+ community workshops on empowerment, supporting vulnerable populations with food assistance programs, or helping casual workers access formal financial services for the first time, I have consistently focused on solutions that improve lives through technology and innovation.

My approach to customer success is fundamentally data-driven and operationally strong. I have extensive experience implementing CRM systems, designing customer satisfaction metrics, and turning insights into actionable improvements. At Schmsoft Ventures, I built comprehensive customer needs assessment frameworks that enabled tailored solutions and enhanced service delivery. This systematic approach to customer experience management would be invaluable in developing Zeno's NPS, CSAT, and churn tracking systems.

Furthermore, my experience in crisis management and stakeholder communication – from responding to refugee queries during humanitarian programs to managing technical support escalations – has prepared me to lead communication during service disruptions while maintaining trust and transparency with customers.

I am particularly drawn to this role because it combines my core strengths: customer relationship leadership, regional expansion experience, team development capabilities, and passion for sustainable impact. I understand that Zeno's success depends not just on innovative technology, but on creating exceptional customer experiences that drive adoption, retention, and loyalty.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my customer success leadership experience and regional expertise can help Zeno achieve its ambitious goals across East Africa. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
