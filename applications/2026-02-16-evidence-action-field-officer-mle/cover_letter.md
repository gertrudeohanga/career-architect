Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the **Field Officer, MLE (Temporary)** position. As a graduate of **Gender and Development** (Egerton University) with over 5 years of intense field experience, I share Evidence Action’s commitment to "rolling up our sleeves" to deliver impact.

While much of my recent experience has been in the private sector, the core of my work has always been **Community Engagement** and **Data Integrity**.

**Why I am the right fit for the Safe Water Now program:**

**1. Data Collection & Quality:**
I am not just a field worker; I am a data steward. At Kwendo and Tenakata, I used mobile-based tools to register clients and conduct baseline surveys. I understand that "garbage in, garbage out" applies to data. I am meticulous in questionnaire administration and comfortable using Android-based data tools (ODK/SurveyCTO) in the field.

**2. Community Entry & Stakeholder Relations:**
I have successfully managed relationships with over **50 Community Groups (Chamas)**. I know how to knock on a door, introduce a program respectfully, and build trust with local Chiefs and Elders. I understand the cultural dynamics of rural communities and how to navigate them to ensure program acceptance.

**3. Field Resilience:**
I thrive in the field. I am physically fit, willing to use motorcycle transport, and adaptable to rural working conditions. Whether in Mumias or Oyugis, I am ready to be deployed where the work is needed.

**4. Academic Foundation:**
My degree in Gender and Development gave me the theoretical grounding in Social Research Methods. I am eager to apply this academic knowledge to the rigorous M&E standards of Evidence Action.

I am available immediately and hold a valid National ID. I am ready to contribute to saving lives through safe water.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
