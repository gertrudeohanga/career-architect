# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Evidence Action (Deworm the World, Safe Water Now). High-impact, data-driven NGO.
- **Role**: Field Officer, MLE (Monitoring, Learning, Evaluation).
- **Match**: This is the role your **BA in Gender and Development** was made for.

## Match Assessment: 9/10 ✅ Excellent Match (Degree + Field Fit)

### The "Perfect" Pivot
1.  **Degree Match:** They ask for "Social Science". You have **BA Gender & Development**. This is exactly what they want.
2.  **Community Engagement:** They want someone to talk to "Chiefs and Residents". You have spent 5 years managing **Chamas** and **Community Groups**. You are an expert at "Community Entry".
3.  **Data Collection:** You have used Fintech apps (Tenakata/Kwendo) to register clients. We will frame this as "Electronic Data Collection".
4.  **Location:** Mumias/Kakamega. Willingness to relocate covers this.

### The Strategy: "The Field Expert"
-   **Pivot form Sales:** We stop calling it "Sales". We call it "Community Mobilization" and "Field Data Collection".
-   **Tools:** We emphasize your ability to use mobile tools (ODK/SurveyCTO equivalent) for data entry.
-   **Motorcycle:** We assume you are okay with this (standard for field officers).

## Recommendation

> ✅ **Apply Immediately (High Prio)**
> 
> This is a role that respects your degree. It offers a path into the NGO/Impact sector, moving away from pure commission sales.
