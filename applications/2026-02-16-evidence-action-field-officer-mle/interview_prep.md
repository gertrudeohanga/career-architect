# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: M&E and Water
*High volume, low cost, strict protocols.*

-   **ODK (Open Data Kit):** The standard tool for mobile data collection.
-   **DSW (Dispensers for Safe Water):** Chlorine dispensers at water points.
-   **Chlorine Residual Testing:** Checking if water actually has chlorine (using a colorimeter or test strips).
-   **Spot Check:** Unannounced visit to verify data.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. Data Integrity (The "Cheating" Question)
**Question:** "You are behind schedule and it's raining. A colleague suggests filling out the survey under a tree instead of visiting the household. What do you do?"
**Answer:** "I refuse. Fabricated data destroys the program's credibility and could cost lives (if we think water is safe when it isn't). I would rather report 'Household Inaccessible due to weather' than submit fake data. I would report the incident to my supervisor."

### 2. Community Resistance
**Question:** "A community member refuses to let you test their water. How do you handle it?"
**Answer:** "I respect their decision first. Then, I try to explain *why* we are doing it (safety/health) without being pushy. If they still refuse, I thank them and leave. I note it in the survey comments. I do not force compliance."

### 3. Motorcycle / Field Movement
**Question:** "Are you comfortable on a motorbike for 6 hours a day?"
**Answer:** "Yes. I have done extensive field work in my previous roles. I prefer being in the field to being in the office."

### 4. Why the Pivot?
**Question:** "You have been a Manager. This is a temporary Field Officer role. Will you be bored?"
**Answer:** "Not at all. I studied Gender and Development because I wanted to do *this* work—impact work. My time in sales gave me grit and discipline, but Evidence Action gives me purpose. I want to learn the 'Evidence Action Way' of doing M&E."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the daily target for household visits?"
2.  "Will we be using tablets provided by the org, or our own devices?"
3.  "Is there a possibility for extension after the temporary contract?"
