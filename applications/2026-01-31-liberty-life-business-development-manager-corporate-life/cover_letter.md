Dear Hiring Manager,

With over five years of experience driving sales strategy, channel management, and revenue growth in Kenya's financial services sector, I am excited to apply for the Business Development Manager, Corporate Life position at Liberty Life. Your commitment to providing comprehensive life and pension solutions through multiple distribution channels aligns with my expertise in building agent networks, managing broker relationships, and driving cross-selling initiatives.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I lead field-based initiatives that have expanded our client base to over 100 businesses while developing strategic partnerships with financial service providers. Previously at My-Credit Limited, I marketed group-based financial products to 50+ client groups, achieved 120% of annual sales targets, and demonstrated the cross-selling and group product expertise directly relevant to Group Life and Pensions distribution. At Ngao Credit, I consistently exceeded monthly targets while building customer relationships that generated 30% repeat business through referrals—the same referral-driven growth model essential for insurance sales.

What draws me to Liberty Life is the opportunity to leverage my financial services experience in the insurance industry. My background in channel distribution through agents, partners, and direct relationships mirrors your Independent Agent, Franchise, and Broker channels. While I am currently pursuing my AIIK certification to formalize my insurance knowledge, my proven ability to train partners, mentor team members, and drive strategic sales initiatives positions me to contribute meaningfully to your Corporate Life business immediately.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my business development experience and passion for financial inclusion can support Liberty Life's growth objectives. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
