## Likely Interview Questions

### Experience & Background

**Q1: You don't have insurance industry experience. Why should we consider you?**

*Sample Answer:*
"While I don't have direct insurance experience, my 5+ years in financial services sales provides directly transferable skills. At My-Credit, I marketed group-based financial products to 50+ client groups - the same group dynamics apply to Group Life. I've worked with agent networks, broker-type partnerships, and achieved 120% of sales targets. I'm also actively pursuing my AIIK certification to formalize my insurance knowledge."

**Q2: Tell me about your experience with cross-selling financial products.**

*Sample Answer:*
"At My-Credit Limited, I cross-sold multiple loan products to existing clients, increasing wallet share per customer. At Kwendo, I leverage our payroll platform to introduce additional financial services. This mirrors the cross-selling of Liberty's product suite. The key is understanding client needs first, then presenting relevant solutions - I've consistently applied this approach."

**Q3: How have you managed and mentored a sales team?**

*Sample Answer:*
"At Schmsoft Ventures, I trained staff on customer service and credit product marketing. At Kwendo, I onboard and train new clients systematically. While I haven't managed a formal BDE team, I've mentored colleagues, shared best practices, and contributed to team target achievement through collaboration and knowledge sharing."

### Technical Knowledge

**Q4: What do you know about Group Life and Pensions products?**

*Key Points to Mention:*
- Group Life provides life cover for employees as part of employer benefits
- Pensions involve long-term savings and retirement planning
- Income Draw Down allows retirees to withdraw from pension funds
- Regulatory framework includes RBA (Retirement Benefits Authority) and IRA

**Q5: How would you approach building relationships with brokers?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'd start by understanding each broker's client base and specialization. Then I'd provide comprehensive product training and support materials. Regular check-ins, quick response to queries, and celebrating their wins builds loyalty. At Ngao Credit, I maintained similar partner relationships that drove 30% of my referral business."

### Behavioral Questions

**Q6: Describe a time you exceeded sales targets.**

*STAR Answer:*
- **Situation:** At My-Credit Limited, I was given annual sales targets for microfinance products
- **Task:** Needed to achieve assigned targets while building sustainable client base
- **Action:** Developed systematic group recruitment approach, identified high-potential segments, provided hands-on client support
- **Result:** Achieved 120% of annual targets, recruited 50+ client groups, processed 500+ applications

**Q7: How do you handle rejection in sales?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I view rejection as feedback. At Ngao Credit, not every lead converted, but I tracked reasons for rejection - timing, pricing, competition. This helped me refine my pitch and targeting. I also maintained relationships with 'not now' prospects, which led to conversions later. Persistence with professionalism is key."
