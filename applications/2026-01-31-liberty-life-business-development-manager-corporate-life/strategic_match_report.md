# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Liberty Life (Insurance & Financial Services)
- **Role**: Business Development Manager, Corporate Life
- **Analysis Date**: 2026-01-31

## Match Assessment: 5/10 ⚠️ Stretch Role

### Strengths (What Aligns)

| JD Requirement | Your Experience | Match |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Sales strategy formulation | 5+ years sales strategy experience across fintech/microfinance | ✅ Strong |
| Cross-selling & revenue generation | Cross-selling experience at My-Credit, Kwendo | ✅ Strong |
| Team mentorship & management | Team leadership at multiple roles | ✅ Moderate |
| Client relationship management | Extensive client relationship experience | ✅ Strong |
| Training partners/clients | Training experience at Kwendo, Schmsoft | ✅ Strong |
| Business development | Core strength across all roles | ✅ Strong |

### Gaps (Concerns)

| JD Requirement | Status | Risk |
|----------------|--------|------|
| 8 years insurance experience | 5 years general BD (not insurance-specific) | ⚠️ High |
| ACII, FLMI, or AIIK qualification | Not held | ⚠️ High |
| IIK, CII, or CIM membership | Not held | ⚠️ High |
| 2 years supervisory in insurance sales | No insurance industry experience | ⚠️ High |
| Group Life/Pensions product knowledge | Limited | ⚠️ Moderate |

### Transferable Experience

Your microfinance and fintech experience in:
- Loan sales and client recruitment (similar sales cycle to insurance)
- Group-based financial products (My-Credit groups → Group Life parallels)
- Financial inclusion focus (aligns with insurance accessibility mission)
- Distribution channel management (agents, partners)

## Recommendation

> ⚠️ **Stretch Application** - Apply if you're willing to emphasize transferable skills and position this as a career transition into insurance. The professional qualification gap (ACII/FLMI/AIIK) is the biggest barrier.

## Key Talking Points

1. **5+ years financial services sales** with consistent target achievement
2. **Group-based product experience** from microfinance translates to Group Life
3. **Channel management** - worked with agents, partners, distribution networks
4. **Training & mentorship** experience developing teams
5. **Willing to pursue AIIK/CII certification** if hired

## Application Decision

**Proceed with caution** — Apply but manage expectations. Focus on transferable skills and willingness to learn insurance. Consider pursuing AIIK certification proactively to strengthen future applications.
