## Final Verdict

**Match Score**: 5/10 ⚠️ WEAK MATCH

**Breakdown**:
- Leadership & Team Management: 8/10 (Strong transferable skills)
- Sales & Customer Service: 7/10 (Proven track record)
- Industry Experience: 1/10 (Zero furniture/retail background)
- Technical Skills (ERP/Inventory): 2/10 (Critical gap)
- Financial Management: 5/10 (Basic skills, no CPA)

The learning curve would be steep, and success is not guaranteed.

**Decision Framework**:
- **Apply if**: You're genuinely interested in transitioning to retail management, willing to learn furniture/home décor industry, comfortable with salary reduction, and open to relocating to Eldoret
- **Skip if**: You want to stay in financial services, need to meet KSh 90K minimum salary, prefer to remain in Nairobi, or aren't interested in retail operations

- If you want to proceed despite the gaps, type "GO"
- If you want to skip this application, type "SKIP"
