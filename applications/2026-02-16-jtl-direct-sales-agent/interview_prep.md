# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: ISP Sales
*Speed, Stability, Price.*
-   **Fiber to the Home (FTTH) vs Business (FTTB):** Know the difference.
-   **Faiba:** The brand name. Known for speed ("Need for Speed").
-   **Last Mile:** The connection from the pole to the house.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The Overqualification "Risk"
**Question:** "You have been a Business Development Manager. Why do you want to be a Direct Sales Agent?"
**Answer:** "I love Sales. Management is great, but I miss the thrill of the close. I want a role where my income is directly tied to my effort (Commissions). JTL is a market leader, and I want to sell a product that everyone needs (Internet)."

### 2. Territory Plan
**Question:** "If we give you 'South B' as your territory, what do you do on Day 1?"
**Answer:** "I don't just walk randomly.
1.  **Map:** I identify the high-density apartments (for FTTH) or office blocks (for FTTB).
2.  **Gatekeepers:** I make friends with the watchmen/caretakers to get access.
3.  **Flyers:** I do a leaflet drop in the morning.
4.  **Knocking:** I return in the evening (6pm-8pm) when people are home from work to close."

### 3. Handling Objections
**Question:** "Customer says 'Zuku/Safaricom is cheaper'. What do you say?"
**Answer:** "I don't fight on price; I fight on **Value**. 'Yes, they might be cheaper, but do you work from home? Can you afford for your Zoom call to drop? Faiba offers dedicated speeds.' I sell the *reliability*, not just the shilling."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "Is this role focused on **Faiba Home** or **Faiba Business**? My strategy differs for each."
2.  "What is the commission structure vs retainer?"
3.  "Does JTL provide branding materials (Branded shirts/tents) for activation days?"
