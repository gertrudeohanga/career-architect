# Application Submission Guide

## Appication Method
-   **Method:** Online (Careers Portal).
-   **Deadline:** Feb 25, 2026.

## Critical Checklist

### 1. Resume
-   We have simplified your resume. It focuses on **"Sales Agent"** and **"Field Work"**.
-   This prevents them from thinking you are "too senior" or "too expensive".

### 2. Form Questions
-   **Expected Salary:** Since it's a contract/commission role, ask for **Retention + Commission** (e.g., 25k-30k Retainer). Don't ask for 100k base here; you make your money on the sales.
-   *Strategy:* If forced to give a single number, put **Negotiable**.

## Messaging
-   **Headline:** Direct Sales Agent | Territory Management & Closing Expert
-   **Why You:** "I am a plug-and-play sales agent. No training needed. Just give me the brochures."
