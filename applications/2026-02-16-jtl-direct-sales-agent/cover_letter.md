Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the **Direct Sales Agent** position at JTL. I am a "Hunter" sales professional who loves the field. With 5 years of experience selling intangible services (Financial Products, Software), selling high-speed internet (Faiba) is a challenge I am ready to crush.

**Why I will succeed at JTL:**

**1. Sourcing & Closing:**
I don't wait for leads. At Ngao Credit and Kwendo, my day started with **Territory Mapping**—identifying which street, building, or office park I would conquer that day. I have a proven track record of knocking on doors, handling rejections, and closing deals on the spot.

**2. Dealer & Sub-Agent Management:**
Your JD mentions "establishing sub-agent accounts." At My-Credit, I managed a network of over **50 Group Leaders** who acted as my sub-agents. I know how to incentivize and train intermediaries to multiply my sales reach.

**3. Reporting & Discipline:**
I understand that field sales requires discipline. I am accustomed to submitting daily call reports and weekly work plans. I treat my territory like my own business, ensuring every potential client is visited and every objection is documented for follow-up.

I am not looking for a desk job; I am looking for a territory to dominate. I am ready to start immediately and delivering numbers in Week 1.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
