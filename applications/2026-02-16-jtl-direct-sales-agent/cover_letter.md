Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the **Direct Sales Agent** position. I am a target-driven sales professional with 5 years of experience in field sales and territory management. I don't wait for leads; I hunt for them.

At **Ngao Credit** and **Kwendo**, I consistently exceeded monthly sales targets by mapping territories and closing deals on the spot. I have experience selling technical services (Software/Fintech) and require zero training to start selling Faiba products. Additionally, I have a proven track record of recruiting and managing sub-agents to multiply sales reach.

I am disciplined, road-ready, and eager to deliver numbers immediately.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
