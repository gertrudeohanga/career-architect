## Likely Interview Questions

### Sales Experience

**Q1: Tell me about your sales experience and track record.**

*STAR Answer:*
- **Situation:** At My-Credit Limited, I was responsible for sales targets in my territory
- **Task:** Achieve monthly and annual sales quotas for loan products
- **Action:** Conducted door-to-door marketing, attended activations, followed up leads consistently, cross-sold to existing clients
- **Result:** Achieved 120% of annual sales targets, highest in my team

**Q2: How do you handle rejection in sales?**

*Sample Answer:*
"Rejection is part of sales. I don't take it personally - I learn from it. I ask myself: Was the timing wrong? Did I miss a need? Can I follow up later? At Ngao Credit, I kept detailed notes on every interaction, so even 'no' became useful data. Some of my best customers initially said no but converted after I addressed their concerns on follow-up."

**Q3: How do you meet your sales targets?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I start with planning - breaking monthly targets into weekly and daily activities. I track my pipeline religiously: how many leads, how many presentations, how many closes. I prioritize high-probability prospects but maintain a full pipeline. Consistency is key - I make sure to do the activities every day, not just when I feel like it."

### Field Sales & Activations

**Q4: Describe your experience with door-to-door marketing.**

*Sample Answer:*
"Door-to-door is where I've built my foundation. At My-Credit, I would map my territory, identify high-traffic areas or target businesses, and work them systematically. The key is being prepared - knowing your product cold, having materials ready, and being respectful of people's time. I generated 30% of my business through referrals from door-to-door contacts."

**Q5: How do you organize your day as a field sales executive?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I plan the night before. Morning is for appointments and follow-ups. Midday is for prospecting and cold outreach. Afternoon is for admin - updating CRM, compiling reports, preparing materials. I batch similar activities together for efficiency. And I always leave buffer time for unexpected opportunities."

### Customer Relationship

**Q6: How do you ensure customer satisfaction?**

*Sample Answer:*
"It's about follow-through. When I promise something, I deliver. I check in after the sale to make sure everything is working well. I remember details about my customers and reference them in follow-up conversations. This approach generated 30% of my sales from referrals - satisfied customers are my best marketing."
