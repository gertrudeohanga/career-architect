Dear Hiring Manager,

With over five years of experience in financial services sales, field
marketing, and customer relationship management, I am excited to apply
for the Direct Sales Executive position at I&M Bank. Your focus on
building customer relationships through personal engagement and
delivering excellent sales results aligns perfectly with my proven track
record of exceeding targets, conducting successful activations, and
generating referral business through exceptional customer service.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I have
acquired over 100 business clients through targeted prospecting, product
demonstrations, and consistent follow-up. At My-Credit Limited, I
achieved 120% of my annual sales targets by conducting door-to-door
marketing, field activations, and promotional campaigns while
cross-selling products to existing clients. At Ngao Credit, my focus on
customer satisfaction generated 30% of my sales through referrals and
repeat business.

What particularly excites me about this opportunity is the chance to
apply my field sales expertise within Kenya’s banking sector. My
experience includes exactly what this role requires: marketing products
to potential customers, setting appointments, assisting with form
completion, attending activations, and compiling comprehensive sales
reports. I am highly motivated, target-driven, and committed to
delivering excellent customer experiences that drive sustainable organic
growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven sales record
can contribute to I&M Bank’s Personal Banking team. I am available for
an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
