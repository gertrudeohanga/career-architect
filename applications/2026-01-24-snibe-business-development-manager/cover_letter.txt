Dear Hiring Team,

As a Business Development professional with 5+ years of experience
driving B2B market expansion and managing distributor partnerships
across East Africa, I was excited to discover the Business Development
Manager position at Snibe. While my background has been in financial
services, the core competencies of product training, distributor
management, and market development translate directly to the medical
device/IVD industry.

At Tenakata Enterprise, I led market expansion initiatives that grew our
distributor network by 35% within three months while maintaining 100%
regulatory compliance. This experience mirrors your requirements for
expanding Snibe’s product presence and managing distributors to ensure
alignment with company strategy. My systematic approach to product
training increased distributor competence by 15%, demonstrating the same
capability needed to enhance brand awareness and train healthcare
professionals on Snibe’s diagnostic products.

My experience accessing both public and private markets, combined with
extensive relationships across Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and
Burundi, positions me perfectly for the East African market access
requirements. During my government internship at the Ministry of Youth
and Gender Affairs, I developed relationships with officials and
community leaders across Kenya - experience that translates directly to
building and maintaining KOL relationships in the healthcare sector.

What particularly draws me to Snibe is the opportunity to apply my
market development skills to the healthcare diagnostics field. Your
focus on IVD products aligns with my interest in solutions that have
meaningful impact on community wellbeing. I’m confident in my ability to
quickly learn the technical aspects of medical devices while bringing
fresh perspectives from B2B partnership development in a different
regulated industry.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in
distributor management, product training, and East African market
expansion can contribute to Snibe’s growth in the region. Thank you for
considering my application.

Sincerely, Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
