Dear Hiring Manager,

With over five years of experience in business development, customer
acquisition, and relationship management, I am excited to apply for the
Business Development Executive position at Lead Compass. Your mission of
empowering parents and guardians in children’s education decisions
resonates with my passion for customer-centric service delivery, and my
experience managing full customer journeys aligns perfectly with this
role’s requirements.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I manage
the complete customer journey—from prospecting and initial engagement
through needs assessment, solution recommendation, service coordination,
and ongoing relationship management. I have acquired over 100 business
clients by understanding their needs and delivering tailored solutions.
At My-Credit Limited, I achieved 120% of sales targets while
coordinating 50+ client groups and building long-term sustainable
relationships that drove retention and referral business. At Ngao
Credit, my commitment to exceptional customer experience generated 30%
of my sales through repeat business and referrals.

What particularly excites me about Lead Compass is the opportunity to
apply my relationship-building and coordination skills in the education
consultancy space. While my background is in financial services, the
core competencies—prospecting, customer engagement, stakeholder
coordination, and service delivery—are directly transferable. I am a
fast learner eager to develop expertise in study abroad advisory and
education pathway guidance, and I bring proven systems for client
relationship management that can immediately contribute to your growth
objectives.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my customer engagement
expertise and results-driven approach can support Lead Compass’ mission.
I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
