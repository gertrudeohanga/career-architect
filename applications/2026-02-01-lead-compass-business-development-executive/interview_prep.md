## Likely Interview Questions

### Business Development Experience

**Q1: Tell me about your experience in business development and client acquisition.**

*STAR Answer:*
- **Situation:** At Kwendo, I was responsible for growing the client base in Kenya
- **Task:** Acquire new business clients and manage the full customer journey
- **Action:** Developed prospecting strategies, conducted needs assessments, recommended tailored solutions, coordinated service delivery, and maintained ongoing relationships
- **Result:** Acquired 100+ clients while maintaining strong satisfaction and retention

**Q2: How do you manage the full customer journey from first contact to follow-up?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I treat the customer journey as a relationship, not a transaction. First contact is about understanding needs—I ask questions and listen. Then I recommend solutions that genuinely fit, not just what I want to sell. During service delivery, I coordinate with internal teams to ensure smooth execution. After delivery, I follow up to ensure satisfaction and look for additional ways to add value. This approach generated 30% of my sales through referrals at Ngao Credit."

**Q3: How would you approach prospecting for an education consultancy?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'd start by understanding the target audience—parents and guardians making education decisions. Key channels would include schools, educational events, parenting forums, and social media communities. I'd build relationships with school administrators and counselors as referral sources. For each prospect, I'd focus on understanding their child's needs and aspirations before recommending any solutions."

### Industry Knowledge

**Q4: Why are you interested in the education sector?**

*Sample Answer:*
"Education decisions shape children's futures—it's meaningful work. I'm drawn to Lead Compass because you're empowering families with information at a crucial decision point. While my background is in financial services, the core skills—understanding client needs, building trust, coordinating solutions—are the same. I'm excited to learn the education landscape and apply my customer engagement expertise in this impactful space."

**Q5: How would you handle a parent who is unsure about study abroad options?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'd start with empathy—it's a big decision with many uncertainties. I'd ask questions to understand their concerns: Is it safety? Cost? The right fit for their child? Then I'd provide relevant information and share examples of similar families we've helped. I wouldn't push—I'd guide them through the decision process, providing resources and follow-up as they work through it. Trust comes from being a helpful resource, not pushy sales."

### Customer Engagement

**Q6: How do you build long-term relationships with clients?**

*Sample Answer:*
"Consistency and follow-through. I stay in touch after the initial engagement, check in on progress, and look for additional ways to add value. I remember details about their situation and reference them in conversations. At My-Credit, this approach built strong retention and referral rates—30% of my business came from satisfied clients recommending me to others."
