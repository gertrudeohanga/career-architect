## EMAIL BODY

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Business Development Officer position at LED Power Technologies (EA) K Ltd.

I am attaching my resume and cover letter for your review. As detailed in my application materials, I bring 5+ years of experience managing end-to-end business processes, coordinating complex projects, and maintaining the highest standards of deadline discipline and compliance accuracy. While my background is in financial services and development rather than engineering, my proven ability to deliver zero-error submissions, manage multiple concurrent processes, and build strong stakeholder relationships directly translates to the requirements of this role.

My experience managing loan applications—a process requiring similar documentation rigor, compliance assurance, and deadline discipline as tendering—has equipped me with the systematic approach and attention to detail that are critical for success in bid management. I'm committed to rapidly mastering the technical aspects of construction tendering and leveraging my commercial evaluation skills to help LED Power Technologies expand its project pipeline.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in process management, compliance, and stakeholder coordination can contribute to your team's success. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

**Getrude Kasinga Ohanga**
