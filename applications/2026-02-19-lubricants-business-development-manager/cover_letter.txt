Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Business Development
Manager position with your organization. With over 5 years of
progressive B2B sales and business development experience driving market
expansion across Kenya, I have consistently delivered revenue growth,
built strategic partnerships, and exceeded sales targets. My proven
track record of developing new markets, managing key accounts, and
strengthening relationships with industrial and commercial customers
positions me to make an immediate impact on your lubricants sector
growth objectives.

At Kwendo, I led business development initiatives that expanded our
market presence across 15+ African businesses, reducing payroll fraud by
40% while building strategic partnerships with 8+ financial service
partners. This experience taught me the critical importance of
understanding complex B2B products, translating technical solutions into
customer value, and managing relationships with both direct clients and
channel partners—skills directly transferable to distributor and
industrial customer management in the lubricants sector. Previously, at
Ngao Credit Limited, I exceeded monthly sales targets by an average of
25% over 12 months by building a systematic approach to lead generation,
needs assessment, and relationship management that converted 70% of
prospects to active clients. At My-Credit Limited, I drove 30%
year-over-year portfolio growth by evaluating 150+ businesses for
financial viability, demonstrating the commercial acumen and analytical
rigor required to assess customer needs and structure appropriate
solutions.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to contribute
to Kenya’s industrial growth by expanding access to quality lubricants
solutions for businesses across key sectors. I am particularly drawn to
the B2B focus of this role and the opportunity to work closely with
distributors and corporate clients to build sustainable revenue streams.
My experience conducting market research, monitoring trends, and
identifying new business opportunities across diverse sectors has
equipped me with the strategic mindset needed to expand your market
footprint. Additionally, my deep understanding of the Kenyan business
landscape, established professional networks, and proven ability to work
independently while collaborating with internal teams align perfectly
with your requirements for a results-driven, proactive business
development professional.

I am confident that my B2B sales expertise, relationship-building
capabilities, and track record of delivering commercial results will
enable me to drive growth and strengthen your market presence in Kenya’s
lubricants sector. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my
experience in developing new markets, managing key accounts, and
building strategic partnerships can contribute to your long-term
business growth objectives. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
