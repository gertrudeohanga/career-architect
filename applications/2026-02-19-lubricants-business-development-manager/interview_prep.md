## Technical/Industry Questions

### Q1: What do you know about the lubricants industry in Kenya, and what trends do you see affecting B2B sales?

**Why they ask**: Testing industry knowledge and market awareness

**Key points to cover**:
- Growth of industrial sector in Kenya driving lubricants demand
- Shift toward quality products and technical support
- Importance of distributor networks in reaching industrial customers
- Competition from international and local brands
- Regulatory standards and quality certifications

**Your approach**:
"While I'm transitioning from financial services to the lubricants sector, I've researched the industry and see strong parallels in B2B sales dynamics. The lubricants market in Kenya is growing with industrial expansion, and I understand that success requires deep customer relationships, technical product knowledge, and strong distributor partnerships—all areas where I have proven experience. I'm particularly interested in how businesses are increasingly seeking not just products but comprehensive solutions including technical support and maintenance programs. My experience quickly learning complex products at Kwendo, where I mastered HR-tech and fintech integration, demonstrates my ability to rapidly develop industry expertise."

**Pitfalls to avoid**:
- Don't pretend to have lubricants expertise you don't have
- Don't dismiss the importance of technical knowledge
- Don't focus only on sales without understanding the product

---

### Q2: How would you approach developing new business opportunities in the industrial lubricants sector?

**Why they ask**: Testing strategic thinking and business development methodology

**Your evidence**: Market expansion at Kwendo (15+ businesses), portfolio growth at My-Credit (30% YoY), sales pipeline at Tenakata

**Model answer outline**:

**Situation**: "At Kwendo, I was tasked with expanding our market presence across African businesses in a competitive HR-tech landscape."

**Action**: "I developed a systematic approach: First, I conducted comprehensive market research to identify high-potential segments—in this case, businesses with large casual workforces. Second, I built a qualification framework to prioritize prospects based on pain points, budget, and decision-making authority. Third, I developed tailored value propositions for each segment. Fourth, I leveraged both direct outreach and partnership channels to reach decision-makers. Finally, I implemented a structured follow-up system to nurture relationships and move prospects through the pipeline."

**Result**: "This approach enabled me to expand our presence across 15+ businesses and identify over $500K in new opportunities within 8 months. I would apply this same systematic methodology to the lubricants sector, focusing on understanding industrial customer pain points, building relationships with key decision-makers, and leveraging distributor partnerships to expand reach."

**Key points**:
- Market research and segmentation

- Metrics-driven approach

---

### Q3: Describe your experience working with distributors or channel partners.

**Why they ask**: Testing distributor management capability (a key requirement)

**Your evidence**: Partnership development at Kwendo (8+ financial service partners), relationship management at Schmsoft

**Model answer outline**:

**Situation**: "At Kwendo, our business model required building strategic partnerships with financial service providers who acted as channel partners, similar to how distributors function in product sales. These partners were critical to our value proposition and market reach."

**Action**: "I developed and managed relationships with 8+ financial service partners by: First, identifying partners whose capabilities aligned with our customer needs. Second, establishing clear communication protocols and mutual success metrics. Third, providing ongoing support and training to ensure partners understood our value proposition. Fourth, maintaining regular check-ins to address challenges and identify growth opportunities. Fifth, creating feedback loops to improve our joint offerings."

**Result**: "This partnership strategy contributed to 85% client retention and 45% improvement in platform adoption. While these were financial service partners rather than product distributors, the relationship management principles are directly transferable: understanding partner motivations, providing support, maintaining communication, and aligning on mutual success metrics."

**Key points**:
- Partner identification and selection
- Relationship building and maintenance
- Support and enablement
- Performance monitoring
- Mutual value creation

**Pitfalls to avoid**:
- Don't claim direct distributor experience you don't have

**Model answer outline**:

**Situation**: "At Tenakata, I was responsible for building and managing a client acquisition pipeline in a competitive loan market with a 2-month timeframe to demonstrate results."

**Action**: "I implemented a structured pipeline approach: First, I established clear pipeline stages (Prospect → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed). Second, I developed qualification criteria to focus on high-probability opportunities. Third, I maintained detailed CRM records tracking all interactions and next steps. Fourth, I implemented a systematic follow-up schedule ensuring no opportunities fell through the cracks. Fifth, I analyzed conversion rates at each stage to identify bottlenecks and optimize the process."

**Result**: "Within 2 months, I built a pipeline of 50+ prospects and achieved a 35% conversion rate, contributing to 20% portfolio expansion. At Ngao Credit, I refined this approach further, managing 200+ prospects over 12 months with a 70% conversion rate and exceeding monthly targets by 25%."

**Key points**:

**Your evidence**: Needs assessment at My-Credit (150+ businesses evaluated), tailored solutions at Schmsoft (60% product uptake)

**Model answer outline**:

**Situation**: "At My-Credit, I was responsible for evaluating diverse SME businesses across different sectors to determine appropriate loan solutions. Each business had unique needs, cash flow patterns, and risk profiles."

**Action**: "I developed a comprehensive needs assessment framework: First, I conducted in-depth discovery conversations to understand the business model, revenue patterns, and growth plans. Second, I analyzed financial statements and cash flow to assess repayment capacity. Third, I identified the specific business challenge the loan would address. Fourth, I matched the customer's needs and capacity to appropriate loan products and terms. Fifth, I clearly communicated how the solution addressed their specific situation."

**Result**: "This approach enabled me to evaluate 150+ businesses while maintaining 95% portfolio quality. The rigorous needs assessment ensured customers received appropriate solutions they could successfully repay. I would apply this same consultative approach to understanding industrial customers' lubrication needs, operational challenges, and technical requirements."

**Key points**:
- Discovery and active listening
- Business/operational analysis
- Problem identification
- Solution matching
- Clear value communication
- Customer success focus

---

### Q6: How do you stay motivated and productive when working independently?

**Why they ask**: Testing self-management and independence (key requirement)

**Your evidence**: Independent work across multiple organizations, exceeded targets at Ngao Credit

**Model answer outline**:

**Situation**: "Throughout my career, I've worked in roles requiring significant independence and self-direction. At Ngao Credit, I was responsible for my own territory with minimal supervision."

**Action**: "I maintain productivity through several practices: First, I set clear weekly and monthly goals aligned with business objectives. Second, I maintain a structured daily routine including prospecting time, client meetings, and follow-up activities. Third, I track my own metrics and KPIs to monitor progress. Fourth, I proactively seek feedback and course-correct when needed. Fifth, I stay motivated by focusing on customer impact and celebrating small wins along the way."

**Result**: "This self-management approach enabled me to consistently exceed monthly sales targets by 25% over 12 months at Ngao Credit, even during challenging market conditions. I thrive in environments where I have autonomy and accountability for results."

**Key points**:
- Goal setting and planning
- Structured routines
- Self-monitoring and metrics
- Proactive communication
- Intrinsic motivation

## Behavioral Questions

### Q1: Tell me about a time when you exceeded a challenging sales target. What was your approach?

**Why they ask**: Testing results orientation and sales capability

**Your evidence**: Exceeded monthly targets by 25% at Ngao Credit over 12 months

**SAR Answer**:

**Situation**: "At Ngao Credit, I was given monthly sales targets for logbook loans in a competitive market with over 10 other providers. The targets were aggressive, and many sales agents struggled to consistently meet them."

**Action**: "I developed a systematic approach to exceed targets: First, I analyzed which customer segments had the highest conversion rates and focused my prospecting there. Second, I built a robust lead generation system combining referrals, networking, and targeted outreach. Third, I implemented a disciplined follow-up schedule ensuring I stayed top-of-mind with prospects. Fourth, I invested time in understanding each customer's specific needs rather than pushing products. Fifth, I maintained detailed records in our CRM to track what worked and optimize my approach."

**Result**: "Over 12 months, I exceeded my monthly sales targets by an average of 25%, achieving 70% conversion rate from prospect to disbursement. I also generated 40% repeat business through exceptional customer service, creating a sustainable pipeline. This performance ranked me among the top sales agents in the organization."

**Key takeaway**: "This experience taught me that consistent excellence comes from systematic processes, customer focus, and continuous optimization based on data."

### Q2: Describe a situation where you had to build a relationship with a difficult or skeptical client. How did you approach it?

**Why they ask**: Testing relationship-building and persistence

**Your evidence**: 85% client retention at Kwendo, relationship management at Schmsoft

**SAR Answer**:

**Situation**: "At Kwendo, I was working with a potential client—a construction company—that had been burned by a previous payroll solution provider. They were highly skeptical of digital platforms and concerned about implementation complexity and data security."

**Action**: "I took a patient, trust-building approach: First, I acknowledged their concerns and asked detailed questions to understand their previous negative experience. Second, I provided transparent information about our platform, including limitations and how we addressed security. Third, I arranged for them to speak with existing clients in similar industries. Fourth, I proposed a small pilot program to demonstrate value with minimal risk. Fifth, I maintained consistent communication throughout, providing updates and being responsive to questions. Sixth, I personally supported their onboarding to ensure a smooth experience."

**Result**: "The client agreed to the pilot, which successfully reduced their payroll processing time by 30% and eliminated ghost worker issues. They became a full client and have since referred two other construction companies to us. This experience reinforced that building trust with skeptical clients requires patience, transparency, proof points, and consistent follow-through."

**Key takeaway**: "I learned that the most valuable long-term clients are often those who start skeptical but become advocates once you've proven your value and reliability."

---

### Q3: Tell me about a time when you had to quickly learn a new product or industry. How did you approach it?

**Why they ask**: Testing learning agility and adaptability (critical for industry transition)

**Your evidence**: Transition to Kwendo (HR-tech/fintech), multiple industry transitions

**SAR Answer**:

**Situation**: "When I joined Kwendo in August 2025, I was transitioning from traditional financial services to a digital HR-tech and fintech platform. I needed to quickly understand payroll digitization, platform technology, integration with financial services, and the unique challenges of businesses with casual workforces—all new domains for me."

**Action**: "I implemented a structured learning approach: First, I spent my first two weeks immersing myself in the product, using it extensively and documenting questions. Second, I scheduled knowledge-sharing sessions with our technical team to understand the platform architecture and capabilities. Third, I studied our existing clients' use cases to understand real-world applications and pain points. Fourth, I researched the broader HR-tech and payroll digitization market to understand competitive positioning. Fifth, I accompanied experienced team members on client calls to observe effective positioning and objection handling. Sixth, I created my own reference materials summarizing key features, benefits, and use cases."

**Result**: "Within one month, I was confidently leading client conversations and within two months, I had expanded our presence to 15+ new businesses. My systematic learning approach enabled me to quickly become effective despite the new domain. I would apply this same methodology to rapidly develop expertise in the lubricants industry."

**Key takeaway**: "I've learned that the ability to quickly master new domains is a skill in itself. My approach combines structured learning, leveraging internal expertise, studying real-world applications, and creating personal reference materials."

---

### Q4: Describe a time when you had to manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities. How did you handle it?

**Why they ask**: Testing stakeholder management capability

**Your evidence**: Stakeholder coordination at Kwendo (clients, partners, internal teams), Ministry experience

**SAR Answer**:

**Situation**: "At Kwendo, I was managing a complex client implementation that required coordination between the client's HR team, their finance department, our technical team, and our financial service partner. Each stakeholder had different priorities: the client's HR wanted quick implementation, finance wanted detailed reporting, our technical team needed time for proper integration, and our partner needed compliance documentation."

**Action**: "I took a structured stakeholder management approach: First, I mapped all stakeholders and their key concerns. Second, I established a clear project timeline with milestones that addressed each stakeholder's priorities. Third, I set up regular communication channels—weekly check-ins with the client, daily updates with our technical team, and bi-weekly syncs with our partner. Fourth, I proactively identified potential conflicts and addressed them early. Fifth, I documented all decisions and requirements to ensure alignment. Sixth, I managed expectations by being transparent about trade-offs and timelines."

**Result**: "The implementation was completed on schedule, all stakeholder requirements were met, and the client achieved 45% improvement in platform adoption. The client's HR and finance teams both expressed satisfaction with the process, and our internal team appreciated the clear communication. This experience taught me that successful stakeholder management requires proactive communication, clear documentation, and balancing competing needs."

**Key takeaway**: "Complex B2B sales and implementations always involve multiple stakeholders. Success requires understanding each stakeholder's priorities, maintaining clear communication, and proactively managing conflicts."

---

### Q5: Tell me about a time when you failed to close a deal or lost a client. What did you learn?

**Why they ask**: Testing self-awareness, resilience, and learning from failure

**Your evidence**: Draw from realistic challenges in your experience

**SAR Answer**:

**Situation**: "At Tenakata, I was working with a promising prospect—a small manufacturing business—that seemed like an ideal fit for our loan products. I had invested significant time in the relationship and was confident about closing the deal."

**Action**: "I went through my standard process: needs assessment, proposal development, and presentation. However, I focused heavily on the financial terms and benefits without adequately addressing their concerns about the application process complexity and timeline. When they raised questions about documentation requirements, I provided standard answers rather than truly listening to their underlying concerns about operational disruption."

**Result**: "The prospect ultimately chose a competitor with a simpler application process, even though our terms were more favorable. I lost the deal, but I learned valuable lessons: First, I realized I had been too focused on product features rather than truly understanding their decision-making criteria. Second, I learned that process simplicity and speed can be more important than optimal terms for some customers. Third, I recognized that I hadn't built enough trust for them to share their real concerns early."

**Key takeaway**: "After this experience, I changed my approach to focus more on discovery and active listening. I now explicitly ask prospects about their decision criteria and concerns early in the process. This has significantly improved my conversion rates. At Ngao Credit, I applied these lessons and achieved a 70% conversion rate. Failure is only valuable if you extract lessons and change your behavior."

---

### Q6: Describe a situation where you had to work with limited resources or support. How did you succeed?

**Why they ask**: Testing resourcefulness and independence

**Your evidence**: Independent work at multiple organizations, achieved results with minimal supervision

**SAR Answer**:

**Situation**: "At Ngao Credit, I was responsible for my own territory with minimal marketing support, no lead generation assistance, and limited training materials. I needed to build my own pipeline and close deals independently."

**Action**: "I became resourceful and self-sufficient: First, I created my own prospecting system by networking at car dealerships, mechanics, and car washes where vehicle owners congregated. Second, I developed my own sales materials and presentations since standard materials were limited. Third, I built a referral program by providing exceptional service to existing clients. Fourth, I studied top performers and adapted their techniques. Fifth, I tracked my own metrics to identify what worked and optimize my approach."

**Result**: "Despite limited resources, I exceeded monthly targets by 25% over 12 months and generated 40% repeat business. I built a sustainable pipeline through referrals and networking that didn't depend on company-provided leads. This experience taught me to be resourceful, creative, and self-reliant—skills that serve me well in any business development role."

**Key takeaway**: "I thrive in environments where I need to figure things out independently. Limited resources force creativity and build resilience."

## Role-Specific Questions

### Q1: Why are you interested in transitioning from financial services to the lubricants industry?

**Why they ask**: Testing motivation and commitment to industry change

**Your approach**:
"I'm excited about this transition because it allows me to apply my proven B2B sales and business development skills to a new industry with strong growth potential in Kenya. What attracts me to the lubricants sector is the opportunity to work with industrial and commercial customers, build distributor partnerships, and contribute to Kenya's industrial growth. While the product is different, the core skills—understanding customer needs, building relationships, managing key accounts, developing new markets—are directly transferable.

I've successfully transitioned between industries before. When I joined Kwendo, I quickly mastered HR-tech and fintech integration despite coming from traditional financial services. I'm confident in my ability to rapidly develop lubricants industry expertise through the same systematic learning approach.

What excites me most is the B2B focus and the opportunity to work with distributors and industrial customers. I see strong parallels between managing financial service partnerships at Kwendo and distributor relationship management. Both require understanding partner motivations, providing support, and aligning on mutual success."

**Key points**:
- Emphasize transferable skills
- Show genuine interest in the industry
- Demonstrate learning agility
- Connect past experience to role requirements
- Express enthusiasm for B2B and distributor work

---

### Q2: What do you think will be your biggest challenge in this role, and how will you address it?

**Why they ask**: Testing self-awareness and problem-solving

**Your approach**:
"I believe my biggest challenge will be developing deep technical knowledge of lubricants products and industrial applications. While I have strong B2B sales skills, I recognize that industrial customers expect their business development partners to understand technical specifications, application requirements, and product performance characteristics.

I plan to address this through several approaches: First, I'll invest significant time in my first 90 days learning product specifications, applications, and competitive positioning. Second, I'll shadow technical team members and experienced sales colleagues to understand how they communicate technical value. Third, I'll visit customer sites to see products in use and understand real-world applications. Fourth, I'll study industry publications and certifications to build foundational knowledge. Fifth, I'll leverage internal expertise by building strong relationships with technical teams who can support complex customer conversations.

I'm confident in my ability to quickly develop this expertise. At Kwendo, I successfully mastered HR-tech and fintech integration within weeks. I'm a fast learner who asks good questions and creates systematic learning frameworks. I also know that customers value business development professionals who understand their operational challenges and can connect them to the right technical resources—not necessarily those who know every technical detail."

**Key points**:
- Show self-awareness of gaps
- Demonstrate concrete plan to address challenges
- Provide evidence of past learning agility
- Balance confidence with humility
- Show understanding of customer expectations

---

### Q3: How would you prioritize your time between developing new business and managing existing accounts?

**Why they ask**: Testing strategic thinking and time management

**Your approach**:
"I believe successful business development requires balancing new business acquisition with existing account management, as both drive sustainable revenue growth. My approach would be to:

First, understand the company's strategic priorities and revenue targets to determine the appropriate balance. If we're in growth mode, I'd weight more heavily toward new business. If we're focused on deepening existing relationships, I'd prioritize account management.

Second, I'd implement a systematic time allocation framework. Based on my experience, I typically allocate 60% of my time to new business development and 40% to existing account management, but I'd adjust based on company priorities and account potential.

Third, I'd segment existing accounts by strategic value and growth potential. High-value accounts with expansion opportunities would receive more attention, while stable accounts would have efficient maintenance protocols.

Fourth, I'd leverage efficient processes for account management—regular check-ins, systematic follow-up, and proactive issue resolution—to maintain relationships without consuming excessive time.

Fifth, I'd look for synergies. Satisfied existing customers become referral sources for new business, and new business development activities often uncover opportunities to strengthen existing relationships.

At Kwendo, I successfully balanced expanding to 15+ new businesses while maintaining 85% retention of existing clients. The key was systematic processes for both activities and clear prioritization based on strategic value."

**Key points**:
- Show strategic thinking
- Demonstrate understanding of both activities' importance
- Provide concrete framework
- Show flexibility based on company priorities
- Provide evidence from past experience

---

### Q4: Why should we hire you for this role?

**Why they ask**: Testing self-awareness and value proposition

**Your approach**:
"You should hire me because I bring a proven track record of B2B sales success, strong relationship-building capabilities, and the ability to quickly develop new markets—exactly what you need to expand your market footprint in Kenya's lubricants sector.

First, I have demonstrated B2B sales excellence. At Kwendo, I expanded market presence across 15+ businesses. At Ngao Credit, I exceeded monthly targets by 25% over 12 months. At My-Credit, I drove 30% year-over-year portfolio growth. I consistently deliver results.

Second, I excel at building and maintaining strategic relationships. I achieved 85% client retention at Kwendo and built partnerships with 8+ financial service partners. I understand that B2B success is built on trust, consistent communication, and delivering value—skills directly applicable to distributor and industrial customer management.

Third, I'm a fast learner who successfully transitions between industries. I've moved from traditional financial services to microfinance to HR-tech, quickly developing expertise in each domain. I'll apply this same learning agility to master the lubricants industry.

Fourth, I bring strong commercial acumen. I've assessed 150+ businesses for financial viability, negotiated contracts, and structured tailored solutions. I understand how to evaluate customer needs and create win-win agreements.

Finally, I'm based in Nairobi with deep understanding of the Kenyan business landscape and established professional networks. I'm results-driven, proactive, and thrive working independently—exactly the profile you've described as your ideal fit.

While I may not have 10+ years of experience, I bring 5+ years of high-impact, progressive B2B sales experience with proven results that demonstrate maturity beyond my years. I'm confident I can make an immediate impact on your growth objectives."

**Key points**:
- Lead with strongest qualifications
- Provide specific evidence
- Address potential concerns proactively
- Show enthusiasm and confidence
- Connect your value to their needs

## Weak Point Defense

### Potential Concern #1: Experience Gap (10+ years requirement vs. 5+ years actual)

**Likely question**: "The role requires 10+ years of experience. You have about 5 years. Why should we consider you?"

**Your pivot**:
"That's a fair question. While I have 5+ years of professional experience rather than 10+, I believe the quality and impact of my experience demonstrates the maturity and capability you're seeking. Let me share why:

First, my experience has been progressive and high-impact. I've consistently taken on increasing responsibility, from sales agent to business development officer to business development manager. Each role has built on the previous one, accelerating my development.

Second, I've delivered results that many professionals with more years don't achieve. I've exceeded sales targets by 25%, achieved 85% client retention, expanded market presence across 15+ businesses, and driven 30% year-over-year growth. These results demonstrate the commercial acumen and execution capability you need.

Third, I've successfully worked across multiple industries—financial services, microfinance, HR-tech—which has given me diverse perspectives and accelerated my learning. This breadth of experience has compressed my development timeline.

Fourth, I've consistently worked independently with minimal supervision, demonstrating the maturity and self-direction typically associated with more senior professionals.

I understand you're looking for someone who can make an immediate impact. My track record shows I can deliver results, build relationships, and drive growth. I'm confident that my 5+ years of high-impact experience will translate to the performance you need in this role."

**Key points**:
- Acknowledge the gap honestly
- Reframe around impact and results
- Provide specific evidence
- Show maturity and self-awareness
- Express confidence without arrogance

---

### Potential Concern #2: Lack of Lubricants Industry Experience

**Likely question**: "You don't have experience in the lubricants industry. How will you get up to speed?"

**Your pivot**:
"You're right that I don't have direct lubricants industry experience, but I believe this is actually an opportunity rather than a limitation. Here's why:

First, I bring fresh perspectives and proven B2B sales methodologies that aren't constrained by 'how things have always been done' in the industry. Sometimes an outside perspective can identify opportunities that industry veterans might miss.

Second, I have a proven track record of quickly mastering new industries. When I joined Kwendo, I had no HR-tech or payroll digitization experience, yet within two months I had expanded our presence to 15+ businesses. I've successfully transitioned between traditional financial services, microfinance, and HR-tech, quickly developing expertise in each domain.

Third, the core skills you need—B2B sales, relationship building, key account management, market development—are transferable across industries. The product changes, but the fundamentals of understanding customer needs, building trust, and delivering value remain constant.

Fourth, I have a systematic approach to learning new domains: immersing myself in the product, leveraging internal expertise, studying customer applications, researching the competitive landscape, and creating reference materials. This approach has worked across multiple industry transitions.

Finally, I'm genuinely excited to learn about the lubricants industry. I've already begun researching the market, key players, and industrial applications. I see this as an opportunity to bring my proven B2B sales skills to a new industry with strong growth potential.

I'm confident that within 90 days, I'll have developed sufficient industry knowledge to be effective, and within six months, I'll be operating at full capacity. My learning agility is one of my strongest assets."

**Key points**:
- Reframe as opportunity, not limitation
- Provide evidence of past learning agility
- Emphasize transferable skills
- Show systematic learning approach
- Demonstrate genuine interest and early research

---

### Potential Concern #3: Limited Distributor Management Experience

**Likely question**: "This role requires working closely with distributors. What's your experience with distributor management?"

**Your pivot**:
"While I haven't managed product distributors specifically, I have extensive experience managing strategic partnerships and channel relationships that function very similarly. Let me explain:

At Kwendo, I developed and managed relationships with 8+ financial service partners who acted as channel partners in our business model. Like distributors, these partners were independent entities with their own business objectives, and our success depended on aligning our goals and supporting their success.

My approach to partner management included: identifying partners whose capabilities aligned with our customer needs, establishing clear communication protocols, providing ongoing support and training, maintaining regular check-ins, creating feedback loops, and monitoring mutual success metrics. This resulted in strong partnerships that contributed to 85% client retention and 45% improvement in platform adoption.

The core principles of distributor management—understanding partner motivations, providing support and enablement, maintaining communication, aligning on mutual success, and managing performance—are the same principles I applied in managing these channel partnerships.

Additionally, at My-Credit and Schmsoft, I worked extensively with intermediaries and referral partners, building relationships that drove business growth.

I recognize that product distribution has specific dynamics around inventory, pricing, territory management, and technical support that I'll need to learn. However, I'm confident that my strong foundation in channel partner management, combined with my learning agility, will enable me to quickly become effective in distributor management.

I'd also add that sometimes bringing experience from adjacent domains can be valuable. I might identify distributor support or enablement approaches that haven't been tried in the lubricants industry."

**Key points**:
- Acknowledge the difference honestly
- Draw clear parallels to relevant experience
- Explain transferable principles
- Show understanding of distributor-specific dynamics
- Express confidence in learning ability
- Reframe as potential advantage
