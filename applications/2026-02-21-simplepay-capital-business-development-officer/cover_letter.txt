Hiring Manager
SimplePay Capital Limited
Coastal Region, Kenya

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Business Development
Officer position at SimplePay Capital Limited. With over six years of
proven experience in financial services, loan disbursement, collections
management, and customer acquisition across Kenya’s microfinance and
lending sectors, I am confident in my ability to achieve and exceed your
branch targets while delivering exceptional customer service.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to
balance aggressive collections targets with customer relationship
excellence. At Ngao Credit Limited, I exceeded monthly sales targets
through systematic lead generation and robust pipeline management while
maintaining strong customer relationships that resulted in repeat
business and referrals. At My-Credit Limited, I ensured all clients
contributed weekly savings and loan repayments on time through diligent
follow-up and relationship management, while simultaneously recruiting
and onboarding new clients to expand our portfolio.

What makes me particularly well-suited for this role is my comprehensive
experience across all aspects of the lending cycle—from customer
acquisition and loan disbursement to collections and account management.
I understand that successful collections require not just persistence,
but also empathy, clear communication, and the ability to work with
customers to find solutions that ensure payment compliance. My track
record includes:

- Consistently achieving and exceeding monthly disbursement and
  collections targets across multiple financial institutions
- Processing loan applications with 100% documentation compliance and
  regulatory adherence
- Conducting thorough KYC and due diligence procedures ensuring
  portfolio quality
- Building strong customer relationships that facilitate payment
  compliance and reduce default rates
- Managing field-based operations independently with minimal supervision

I am particularly drawn to SimplePay Capital’s focus on serving
customers across Kenya’s diverse regions. My experience working in both
urban and rural settings, combined with my fluency in English and
Swahili, positions me to effectively engage with customers across the
Coastal Region. I am open to relocation and excited about the
opportunity to contribute to SimplePay Capital’s growth in this market.

I am confident that my proven ability to achieve KPIs, my strong
collections and customer service skills, and my commitment to
operational excellence make me an ideal candidate for this position. I
would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with
SimplePay Capital’s goals and how I can contribute to your branch’s
success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the
opportunity to discuss this position further.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
