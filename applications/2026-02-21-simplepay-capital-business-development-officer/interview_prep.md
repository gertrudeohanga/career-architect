## Anticipated Interview Questions & Responses

### Collections & Account Management

**Q: "Describe your experience with collections and ensuring customers pay on time."**

A: "At My-Credit Limited, I managed a portfolio where I ensured all clients contributed weekly savings and loan repayments on time. My approach combined systematic follow-up with relationship management—I maintained regular contact with clients, sent payment reminders before due dates, and worked with customers facing challenges to create payment plans. At Ngao Credit, I guided clients through the complete loan process and maintained strong relationships that facilitated payment compliance. My success came from balancing firmness on payment expectations with empathy and problem-solving when customers faced genuine difficulties."

**Q: "How do you handle customers who are overdue on payments?"**

A: "I use a structured approach: First, I contact the customer immediately after the due date to understand the situation—sometimes it's a simple oversight. Second, I assess whether it's a temporary cash flow issue or a deeper problem. For temporary issues, I work with the customer to create a catch-up plan. For more serious situations, I escalate appropriately while maintaining the relationship. Throughout, I document all interactions and maintain professional, respectful communication. At My-Credit, this approach helped me maintain portfolio quality while preserving customer relationships."

**Q: "What strategies do you use to minimize defaults?"**

A: "Prevention starts at the beginning—thorough KYC, business viability assessment, and setting appropriate loan amounts based on repayment capacity. I learned at My-Credit to assess business models carefully before disbursement. During the loan period, I maintain regular contact, not just when payments are due. This helps me identify potential issues early. I also educate customers on the importance of maintaining good credit history and how it affects their future borrowing capacity. Finally, I ensure customers have my contact information and feel comfortable reaching out if they anticipate payment challenges."

### Target Achievement & Performance

**Q: "Tell me about a time you exceeded your targets."**

A: "At Ngao Credit Limited, I consistently exceeded monthly sales targets through a combination of effective lead generation and robust pipeline management. I developed a systematic approach: I identified high-potential customer segments, maintained a healthy pipeline of prospects at different stages, and focused on quality conversions rather than just volume. I also leveraged referrals from satisfied customers, which became a significant source of new business. My success came from treating each customer interaction as an opportunity to build a long-term relationship, not just close a single transaction."

**Q: "How do you prioritize when you have multiple targets—disbursement, collections, and new customers?"**

A: "I use a time-blocking approach. Mornings are typically for collections follow-up when customers are most reachable and before they spend their day's cash. Mid-day I focus on new customer meetings and loan processing. Afternoons are for account reviews and planning. However, I remain flexible—if a customer commits to a payment at a specific time, I prioritize that. I also use CRM systems to track all activities and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. The key is systematic planning while remaining responsive to urgent situations."

**Q: "What's your approach to achieving monthly KPIs across multiple metrics?"**

A: "I break monthly targets into weekly and daily goals, which makes them more manageable and allows me to course-correct quickly if I'm falling behind. I track my progress daily and identify which KPIs need more attention. I also recognize that the metrics are interconnected—strong customer service and relationship management support both collections and new customer acquisition through referrals. At Tenakata, this systematic approach helped me achieve 100% compliance while meeting portfolio growth targets."

### Customer Service & Relationship Management

**Q: "How do you balance aggressive collections with maintaining good customer relationships?"**

A: "The key is professional empathy. I'm clear about payment expectations and consequences, but I also listen to customers' situations and work with them to find solutions. I've found that most customers want to pay—they just sometimes need flexibility or a payment plan. By being solution-oriented rather than punitive, I maintain relationships while achieving collections targets. At Ngao Credit, this approach resulted in repeat business and referrals even from customers who had faced payment challenges."

**Q: "Describe a difficult customer situation and how you handled it."**

A: "At My-Credit, I had a client whose business faced unexpected challenges and couldn't make payments. Rather than immediately escalating, I visited the business to understand the situation. I discovered it was a temporary supply chain issue, not a fundamental business problem. I worked with the client to create a modified payment plan and stayed in regular contact. The client recovered and not only completed the loan but became one of our best customers, referring several other businesses. This taught me the value of investigation and flexibility within appropriate boundaries."

### Field Work & Independence

**Q: "This role requires significant field work. How do you manage your time in the field?"**

A: "I plan my field routes efficiently to maximize customer visits while minimizing travel time. I group customers by location and schedule visits strategically—for example, visiting customers near their businesses during operating hours. I use mobile tools to update records in real-time and communicate with the office. At Kwendo, my field-based work required independence and self-management, which I handled by maintaining detailed daily plans while remaining flexible for urgent customer needs."

**Q: "How do you work with minimal supervision?"**

A: "I'm highly self-motivated and results-oriented. I set clear daily and weekly goals aligned with monthly targets, track my own performance, and proactively communicate with management about progress and challenges. At Ngao Credit, I worked largely independently, managing my own pipeline and schedule. I believe in taking ownership of my results and seeking guidance when needed rather than waiting for direction."

### KYC & Compliance

**Q: "What's your experience with KYC and due diligence procedures?"**

A: "I have extensive experience conducting KYC across multiple financial institutions. At My-Credit and Ngao Credit, I processed loan applications ensuring complete documentation compliance. This includes verifying identity documents, assessing business viability, checking references, and conducting site visits when appropriate. I understand that thorough KYC protects both the institution and the customer. At Tenakata, I maintained 100% compliance with all regulatory requirements, which I consider non-negotiable."

**Q: "How do you ensure compliance with SOPs while meeting aggressive targets?"**

A: "Compliance and targets aren't mutually exclusive—proper procedures actually support target achievement by ensuring portfolio quality. I've learned that cutting corners on KYC or documentation creates problems later. I build compliance into my workflow so it's systematic rather than an afterthought. At Tenakata, I achieved portfolio growth while maintaining 100% regulatory compliance by treating procedures as enablers of sustainable growth, not obstacles."

### Location & Relocation

**Q: "This position is based in the Coastal Region. Are you willing to relocate?"**

A: "Yes, I'm open to relocation within Kenya. I see this as an opportunity to expand my experience in a new market and contribute to SimplePay Capital's growth in the Coastal Region. I've worked across diverse settings in Kenya and am comfortable adapting to new environments. I'm particularly interested in understanding the unique dynamics of the Coastal market and building strong customer relationships in the region."

**Q: "What do you know about the Coastal Region market?"**

A: "The Coastal Region has a diverse economy including tourism, port activities, agriculture, and trade. The customer base likely includes small business owners, traders, and individuals with varied income patterns. I understand that building trust and relationships is particularly important in regional markets, and my experience working across Kenya's diverse communities has prepared me to adapt to local business cultures and customer needs."

### Salary & Compensation

**Q: "What are your salary expectations?"**

A: "I'm focused on finding the right opportunity where I can contribute and grow. I understand this position offers KSh 30,000 to 45,000, and I'm interested in discussing the complete compensation package including any performance bonuses, benefits, and growth opportunities. I'm confident that my proven track record of exceeding targets and my comprehensive experience in collections and customer acquisition will deliver strong ROI for SimplePay Capital."

*Note: This is a diplomatic response given the significant salary gap. Be prepared that they likely cannot negotiate significantly above the stated range.*

## Salary Negotiation Strategy

### Your Position
- **Stated Range**: KSh 30,000 - 45,000
- **Your Minimum**: KSh 90,000 (from identity.json)
- **Reality**: This role likely cannot meet your minimum

### Negotiation Approach

**If they offer KSh 30-35K:**
"I appreciate the offer. Given my six years of experience and proven track record of exceeding targets, I was hoping for something closer to the top of the range. Is there flexibility to offer KSh 45,000 plus performance bonuses?"

**If they offer KSh 40-45K:**
"Thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the role and confident I can deliver strong results. Are there performance bonuses or incentives tied to exceeding targets? I'd also like to understand the benefits package and any opportunities for salary review based on performance."

**If they cannot negotiate:**
Be prepared to politely decline if the compensation doesn't meet your needs. You can say: "I appreciate the opportunity and the time you've taken with me. However, given my current compensation and experience level, I don't think this is the right fit at this time. I hope we can stay in touch for future opportunities that might be better aligned."
