## Weak Point Defense

**Potential concern**: Lack of formal advanced degree (MBA/MSc/MA requirement)
**Likely question**: "The role requires an advanced degree, but you have a BA. How do you address this gap?"
**Your pivot**: "While I have a BA in Gender and Development, I've gained the equivalent of advanced degree knowledge through seven years of progressive, hands-on experience conducting the exact type of work this role requires. My practical experience includes systematic gender analysis across multiple contexts, participatory research with diverse populations, and program assessment work that has directly informed policy decisions. I've essentially been doing gender audit work throughout my career, from assessing WFP program effectiveness to evaluating government gender programs. I believe this combination of foundational academic training plus extensive practical application provides me with both the theoretical grounding and real-world expertise needed to excel in this role."

**Potential concern**: Limited formal gender audit experience
**Likely question**: "This role specifically requires gender audit experience. Can you elaborate on your relevant experience?"
**Your pivot**: "While I may not have conducted formal 'gender audits' with that specific title, I have extensive experience conducting the core components of gender audit work. For example, my assessment of WFP aid effectiveness involved systematic review of program documents, stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions, and analysis of how gender, age, and displacement status affected access to services—which is essentially a gender audit methodology. Similarly, my work monitoring gender-based violence rates involved assessing how well programs addressed gender equality goals and identifying gaps in service delivery. I've been applying gender audit principles throughout my career, just in different organizational contexts."

## Questions to Ask Them

1. "What are the biggest challenges you anticipate for this gender audit, and what would success look like from your perspective?"

2. "How will the findings and recommendations from this audit be integrated into program implementation, and what support exists for acting on the recommendations?"

3. "What is the timeline for the audit, and what resources and access will be available for stakeholder engagement and data collection?"

4. "How does this audit fit into the broader monitoring and evaluation framework for the Sanara Program?"

5. "What opportunities exist for the consultant to present findings to different stakeholder groups and support implementation of recommendations?"
