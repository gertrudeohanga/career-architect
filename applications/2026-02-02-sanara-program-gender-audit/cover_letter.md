Dear Sanara Program Hiring Team,

Your comprehensive gender audit initiative represents exactly the kind of systematic, intersectional approach to development programming that drives meaningful change. With my BA in Gender and Development from Egerton University and seven years of hands-on experience conducting gender analysis, participatory research, and program assessment across NGO, government, and private sector contexts in Kenya, I am uniquely positioned to deliver the rigorous analysis and actionable recommendations your program requires.

My experience directly aligns with your audit requirements in three critical areas. First, I have extensive expertise in participatory research with marginalized populations—from conducting systematic interviews with 200+ refugees across Kakuma, Kalobeyei, and Dadaab camps for World Food Programme effectiveness assessments, to facilitating 50+ community workshops on gender-based violence prevention that reached over 1,000 participants through Maendeleo Ya Wanawake. This work required the exact intersectional analysis framework your audit demands, as I regularly assessed how gender, disability, age, and displacement status created compounding barriers to accessing services and opportunities. Second, my business development experience at Kwendo and multiple financial institutions provides deep understanding of financing models and access barriers—I've evaluated 200+ SME loan applications, analyzed market penetration strategies, and identified systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from accessing capital. Finally, my government internship with the Ministry of Youth and Gender Affairs involved direct program assessment work, including evaluating the effectiveness of Uwezo fund loans, KYEOP training programs, and Inua Jamii cash transfers, giving me practical experience with the kind of multi-component program analysis your audit requires.

What particularly draws me to this opportunity is the Sanara Program's focus on creative industries and youth employment—sectors where I've seen firsthand how traditional approaches often fail to address the unique challenges faced by young women, refugees, and persons with disabilities. My work at Kwendo, digitizing payroll for Africa's casual workforce, taught me how innovative approaches to financial inclusion can transform entire ecosystems when they're designed with intersectional barriers in mind. I'm passionate about gender development and financial inclusion because I've witnessed how systematic exclusion perpetuates cycles of poverty, and how well-designed interventions can create ripple effects of empowerment. My deep understanding of Kenyan socio-cultural dynamics, combined with my ability to translate complex research findings into practical program improvements, positions me to deliver the kind of audit that doesn't just identify gaps but provides a clear roadmap for transformation.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of academic foundation, practical research experience, and business development acumen can contribute to strengthening the Sanara Program's gender equality and social inclusion outcomes. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
