## Likely Interview Questions

### Experience & Background

**Q1: You have financial services experience but not in real estate/investments. How will you adapt?**

*Sample Answer:*
"The core sales and BD skills transfer directly. At My-Credit, I sold financial products that required trust-building, needs assessment, and long-term relationship management - exactly what investment products require. The key difference is the product knowledge, which I'm committed to learning rapidly. My experience with SACCOs and corporate clients gives me existing relationships I can leverage for KICL's partnership model."

**Q2: Tell me about a time you exceeded sales targets significantly.**

*STAR Answer:*
- **Situation:** At My-Credit Limited, I was assigned annual sales targets for microfinance products
- **Task:** Needed to achieve targets while building a sustainable client portfolio
- **Action:** Developed systematic group recruitment strategy, focused on high-potential segments, provided exceptional client support to drive referrals
- **Result:** Achieved 120% of annual targets, recruited 50+ client groups, built a referral network generating 30% repeat business

**Q3: How would you structure partnerships with banks and SACCOs?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'd start by mapping existing relationships both parties have and identifying mutual benefits. For banks, I'd position our investment products as complementary to their savings products. For SACCOs, I'd develop co-branded investment options for their members. I've successfully developed SACCO partnerships in my microfinance work - the key is demonstrating value for their members while making it operationally simple for them."

### Leadership & Team Management

**Q4: How have you led and developed a sales team?**

*Sample Answer:*
"At Schmsoft Ventures, I led team training on customer service and product knowledge. At Kwendo, I onboard and mentor new team members on our sales process. While I haven't managed a formal reporting structure, I set personal KPIs and track performance metrics daily. I believe in coaching through joint client calls, celebrating wins publicly, and addressing performance gaps privately with actionable improvement plans."

**Q5: How would you set and monitor KPIs for a sales team?**

*Key Points:*
- Lead metrics (calls, meetings, proposals) vs lag metrics (revenue, closures)
- Weekly pipeline reviews and monthly performance assessments
- Individual targets aligned to team objectives
- Use of CRM for tracking and accountability
- Recognition programs for top performers

### Strategic Questions

**Q6: How would you identify new markets and revenue streams for KICL?**

*Sample Answer:*
"I'd start with data analysis - where are current clients coming from, what segments are underrepresented? I'd research demographics of investment-ready Kenyans - diaspora, young professionals, retiring workers. Then I'd evaluate channel opportunities - are there SACCOs or employer partnerships we haven't tapped? Finally, I'd pilot test with minimal investment before scaling successful approaches."
