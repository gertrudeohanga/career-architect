Dear Hiring Manager,

With over five years of experience driving revenue growth, strategic partnerships, and client portfolio development in Kenya's financial services sector, I am excited to apply for the Business Development Manager position at Kimisitu Investment Company Limited. Your focus on delivering investment products through partnerships with banks, SACCOs, and developers directly aligns with my expertise in building distribution channels and driving market penetration.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I have acquired over 100 business clients through strategic prospecting and relationship management while developing partnerships with financial institutions for co-marketing initiatives. Previously at My-Credit Limited, I achieved 120% of annual sales targets marketing financial products to individual and corporate clients, recruited and managed 50+ client groups, and processed 500+ applications while maintaining portfolio quality. At Ngao Credit, I consistently exceeded monthly targets while building client relationships that generated 30% repeat business through referrals—the same relationship-driven growth model essential for investment product sales.

What draws me to KICL is your comprehensive approach combining real estate investments, strategic partnerships, and customer-centric service delivery. My experience in financial product marketing, SACCO partnerships, and corporate client management provides a strong foundation for driving KICL's revenue targets and market share growth. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to structure distribution partnerships and lead a high-performance sales team toward ambitious growth objectives.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my business development track record and strategic partnership experience can contribute to KICL's expansion goals. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
