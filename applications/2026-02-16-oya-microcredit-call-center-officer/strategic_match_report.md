# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Oya Microcredit (Digital-first/Fast-growing MFI).
- **Role**: Call Center Officer.
- **Core Function**: Telesales, Customer Support, and **Collections**.

## Match Assessment: 9/10 ✅ Excellent Match (Experience Fit)

### The "Perfect Industry" Fit
1.  **Microfinance DNA:** You have 5 years in exactly this sector (Ngao/My-Credit/Kwendo). You know the products ("Logbook Loans", "Check-off", "SME Loans") inside out.
2.  **Collections Experience:** The JD mentions "Support collections". In Microfinance, every Sales Officer is also a Collections Officer. You have done this for years.
3.  **Overqualified (Asset):** They ask for 1-3 years. You have 5. This makes you a "Plug and Play" candidate who needs zero training on how a loan cycle works.

### The Strategy: "The Seasoned Pro"
-   **Resume Tweak:** Highlight "Telesales" and "Phone-based Debt Recovery" in your previous bullets.
-   **Degree:** They ask for a Business Degree. Your BA in Gender is fine because your *experience* is heavily financial. We will emphasize your "Financial Inclusion" angle.

## Recommendation

> ✅ **Apply (Safety / Strong Match)**
> 
> This is a very safe bet. The work might be repetitive compared to your Field Officer roles, but it is a stable office job in your core industry.
