Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the **Call Center Officer** position at Oya Microcredit. With over 5 years of experience in the Microfinance sector (Ngao Credit, My-Credit, Kwendo), I am not just a "Call Center Agent"—I am a Microfinance specialist who knows how to talk to borrowers.

**Why I am the perfect fit for Oya:**

**1. I Speak "Borrower":**
I understand the unique psychology of an MFI client. Whether they are inquiring about a top-up or explaining why they missed a payment, I have handled thousands of these conversations. I know how to explain interest rates simply and how to negotiate a "Promise to Pay" effectively.

**2. Telesales & Collections Hybrid:**
In my previous roles, the phone was my primary tool. At Kwendo, I managed a daily call list of 50+ clients, balancing **Sales calls** (onboarding new SMEs) with **Collections calls** (reminders). I understand that a Call Center Officer in an MFI must be versatile—part customer service, part sales, part debt recovery.

**3. Accuracy & Systems:**
I am disciplined in CRM data entry. I understand that a missing note in the system can lead to a bad customer experience or a lost collection opportunity. I am proficient in MS Office and quick to learn new loan management systems.

I am ready to join Oya Microcredit and deliver professional, results-oriented customer service from Day 1.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
