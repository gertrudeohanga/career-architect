# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: Digital Microfinance
*Speed, empathy, and repayment.*
-   **PAR (Portfolio at Risk):** The key metric.
-   **KYC (Know Your Customer):** Verifying ID/Photo over the phone/app.
-   **CRB (Credit Reference Bureau):** The threat/consequence for non-payment.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. Handling the "Angry Customer"
**Question:** "A client calls screaming that they were listed on CRB unfairly. What do you do?"
**Answer:** "1. **Listen:** Let them vent. DO NOT interrupt. 2. **Empathize:** 'I understand why you are frustrated.' 3. **Verify:** Check the system. 4. **Solve:** If it's an error, escalate to IT immediately. If it's valid (they defaulted), explain the policy calmly and offer a path to clearance (repayment)."

### 2. The Sales Pitch
**Question:** "Sell me a loan top-up over the phone."
**Answer:** "Hello [Name], I see you have successfully paid off 80% of your current loan. Because of your good record, you now qualify for a KSh 50,000 top-up at the same rate. We can disburse it to your M-Pesa in 10 minutes. Would you like me to process that for you?"

### 3. Collections (Soft vs Hard)
**Question:** "A client promised to pay yesterday but didn't. Call them."
**Answer:** "Hi [Name], this is Getrude from Oya. We noticed we didn't receive your installment yesterday as discussed. Is there an issue with M-Pesa? (Pause). Okay, can you make the payment right now while we are on the phone so I can update your record and avoid any penalties?"

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the daily target for outbound calls?"
2.  "Does the call center handle purely inbound queries, or is there a heavy focus on Collections/Recovery?"
3.  "What CRM or Telephony system does Oya use?"
