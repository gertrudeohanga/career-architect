Dear Hiring Team,

As a Business Development professional with 5+ years of experience driving B2B partnership growth and exceeding sales targets consistently, I was thrilled to discover the Business Development Manager East Africa position at RateHawk. Your mission to make travel more widely available and simpler for everyone resonates deeply with my background in expanding access to financial services across underserved communities in Kenya.

While my experience has been in financial services, the core competencies translate directly to travel industry partnerships. At Tenakata Enterprise, I engineered partnership development initiatives that expanded our partner network by 35% within three months while maintaining 100% compliance standards. This experience mirrors your requirements for signing up new partners and providing system training. At Ngao Credit Limited, I exceeded monthly sales targets by 20-30% through systematic partner generation and qualification - demonstrating the same results-focused approach you're seeking for travel agency and tour operator partnerships.

My native fluency in both Swahili and English, combined with deep understanding of East African markets, positions me perfectly to develop the region's travel market. I've successfully conducted market research across diverse Kenyan communities, identifying high-potential segments and improving targeting efficiency by 35%. This analytical approach to market development would serve RateHawk well in expanding presence across tour operators, travel agencies, and OTAs.

What particularly draws me to RateHawk is the opportunity to apply my partnership development skills to the innovative travel-tech space. Your emphasis on technology and global presence aligns with my appetite for innovative solutions and international mindset. I'm excited by the prospect of learning the travel industry while bringing fresh perspectives from B2B partnership development in a different sector.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in B2B sales, partnership training, and market analysis can contribute to RateHawk's expansion across East Africa. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
