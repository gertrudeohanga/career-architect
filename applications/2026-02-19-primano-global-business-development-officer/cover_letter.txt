Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Business Development Officer position at
Primano Global Limited. With over six years of proven success in B2B
software/SaaS sales, field sales across Kenya, and consultative selling,
I bring a track record of consistently exceeding sales targets by 25%+
through systematic lead generation and complete sales cycle management.
At Kwendo, I sold a digital payroll platform to 15+ African
businesses—conducting tailored product demonstrations, explaining
technical features and integrations, training clients on platform usage,
and coordinating with implementation teams to ensure smooth customer
onboarding. This experience directly translates to selling POS,
Inventory Management, and Online store solutions, where the sales
methodology is identical: understand business operational challenges,
demonstrate how the software solves pain points, and ensure successful
implementation. I am based in Nairobi with extensive field sales
experience across 8+ Kenyan counties, proficient in CRM tools and MS
Office, and immediately available to drive revenue growth for Primano
RetailX.

My software/SaaS sales experience at Kwendo mirrors the core
requirements of this role. I managed the complete sales cycle from lead
generation to deal closure, conducting product demonstrations tailored
to each business’s specific needs, explaining technical features and
integrations in accessible language, and training clients on platform
usage to optimize adoption. I achieved an 85% client retention rate by
working closely with implementation teams to ensure smooth onboarding,
identifying upsell and cross-sell opportunities within existing
accounts, and maintaining proactive communication with key
decision-makers. Additionally, my field sales experience across 8+
Kenyan counties at My-Credit Limited—where I drove 30% year-over-year
growth by prospecting and onboarding 200+ SME clients including retail
stores, restaurants, and service businesses—demonstrates my ability to
succeed in field-based B2B sales with travel requirements. I understand
retail and hospitality business workflows from assessing 150+ SMEs,
identifying their operational challenges around inventory management,
cash flow tracking, and operational efficiency—the exact pain points
that POS and Inventory Management software addresses.

What excites me most about Primano Global Limited is the opportunity to
contribute to a fast-growing fintech/retail-tech company that’s
digitizing operations for retail and hospitality businesses across
Kenya. I am passionate about technology solutions that improve business
efficiency, and I bring strong market intelligence capabilities—at
Kwendo, I conducted market research across 5 target segments, gathered
competitive intelligence on pricing and features, and provided strategic
insights to HQ that informed product development and identified $500K+
in new opportunities. I have also supported marketing initiatives by
developing sales collateral, participating in partner events, and
contributing to lead generation campaigns. My consultative selling
approach, combined with my ability to build and maintain strong
relationships with key decision-makers, positions me to not only meet
but exceed monthly and quarterly sales targets while ensuring high
customer satisfaction and long-term retention.

I am immediately available and excited about the opportunity to join
Primano RetailX. I am confident that my B2B software sales experience,
field sales success across Kenya, consultative selling approach, and
genuine enthusiasm for the fintech/retail-tech space will enable me to
drive significant revenue growth for Primano Global Limited. I would
welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven track record and
transferable skills can contribute to your sales objectives.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking
with you soon.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
