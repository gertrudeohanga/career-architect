# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Unilever (FMCG Giant)
- **Role**: Area Sales Manager (ASM) Central
- **Location**: Nairobi / Central Region
- **Analysis Date**: 2026-02-12
- **Deadline**: Urgent (Feb 13)

## Match Assessment: 8/10 ✅ Strong Match

### Strengths (Why you fit)

| JD Requirement | Your Experience | Match |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Field Sales Experience (3-5 yrs)** | 5+ years in Field Sales (My-Credit, Ngao, Kwendo). | ✅ Excellent |
| **Team Leadership** | Managed teams of Sales Agents/Territory Officers (50+ partners). | ✅ Strong |
| **Territory Expansion** | "Managed field sales... across assigned territories" (Schmsoft). | ✅ Direct |
| **Distributor/Partner Mgmt** | Managed 50+ partner groups (My-Credit). | ✅ Transferable |
| **Financial Hygiene** | Experience with credit compliance and recovering "outstanding fees". | ✅ Strong |

### Potential Gaps & Strategy

| Requirement | Analysis | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **FMCG Specifics** | Your background is Finance/Fintech, not FMCG (Soap/Food). | Frame "Partner Groups" as "Distributors". The mechanics of territory management (Route to Market) are similar. |
| **Key Distributor Management** | "Essential" requirement. | Emphasize managing *Channel Partners* who resell/distribute products (even if financial products). |
| **Trade Category Management** | Likely minimal exposure. | Focus on "Portfolio Management" and "Product Performance Analysis". |

### Key Strategy
This is a **Territory & People Management** role. Unilever wants someone who can own a region.
- **The Narrative:** You are a "Territory Architect". You don't just sell; you build the infrastructure (partners, teams, routes) that *allows* sales to happen.
- **Transferable Skill:** "Managing a network of 50+ partners" is your proxy for "Distributor Management".
- **Urgency:** The deadline is tomorrow. We need to move fast.

## Recommendation

> ✅ **Submit Immediately**
> 
> You meet the core need: A leader who can manage a field team and a network of partners. The pivot from Service/Finance to FMCG is a jump, but your operational rigor (managing PAR/Collections) is a huge asset for "Financial Hygiene".
