Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Area Sales Manager
Central position at Unilever. As a sales leader who has successfully
managed high-volume territories, led field teams of over 50 people, and
consistently exceeded revenue targets (120%), I am confident in my
ability to drive sustainable growth for Unilever’s professional
category.

I understand that the ASM role is not just about “selling”—it is about
building the infrastructure for sales. It requires a leader who can
manage distributor health, optimize routes, and ensure financial
control, all while motivating a field force. Here is how my experience
aligns:

1. Territory & Partner Management: At My-Credit Limited, I managed a
network of over 50 partner groups, which functioned similarly to a
distributor network. My role was to ensure they were “active,”
financially healthy, and compliant with our service standards. I
successfully expanded our footprint by identifying under-served zones
and on-boarding new partners, directly mirroring the “Establish
Distributor Networks” responsibility in your JD.

2. Financial Hygiene & Operations: I have a deep respect for the
“boring” but critical side of sales—controls. I have extensive
experience managing credit limits, reconciling partner accounts, and
recovering outstanding dues. I understand that a sale is not complete
until the money is in the bank and the stock is accounted for. I have a
proven track record of maintaining system hygiene and minimizing losses.

3. Field Leadership: “Leading field sales force” is where I thrive. I
don’t lead from behind a desk; I lead from the front. I have recruited,
trained, and coached teams of up to 30 territory officers, instilling a
culture of performance and resilience. I believe in co-developing
strategies with my team and then holding us all accountable to the
execution.

I am energized by the opportunity to work for a purpose-driven company
like Unilever. I bring the grit, the strategic thinking, and the
“Seizing the Future” mindset required to lead the Central Region to new
heights.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
