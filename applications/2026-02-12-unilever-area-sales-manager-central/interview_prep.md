# Interview Preparation

## Company Research
- **Name:** Unilever Kenya
- **Purpose:** "To make sustainable living commonplace."
- **Focus:** FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) - Personal Care, Home Care, Foods.
- **Values:** Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Pioneering.
- **Role Context:** "Customer Development" (Sales). The ASM owns the "Last Mile" execution.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. Distributor Management
**Question:** "How do you manage a distributor who is underperforming?"
**Answer:** "I use a data-driven approach. First, I analyze the gap: Is it **Stock** (Availability), **Sales Team** (Capability), or **Finance** (Working Capital)?
- If **Stock:** We review order cycles.
- If **Team:** I join them for a market visit to coach.
- If **Finance:** We review the ROI and credit terms.
I believe in 'Joint Business Planning'—getting buy-in on the fix, not just dictating it."

### 2. Territory Strategy / Route to Market (RTM)
**Question:** "You are given a new territory. How do you plan to grow it?"
**Answer:** "I start with **Mapping**. Currently, what is our Numeric Distribution (how many shops have stock)?
1.  **Segmentation:** Tier the outlets (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
2.  **Coverage:** Ensure the sales team's journey plan covers the high-potential outlets efficiently.
3.  **Gap Analysis:** Identify 'White Spaces' where we have zero presence and assign a 'Hunter' strategy to recruit new stockists there."

### 3. Team Leadership
**Question:** "Tell me about a time you motivated a demotivated team."
**Answer:** "At My-Credit, morale dipped after a target hike. I organized a 'Field Blitz' week where I went out with the team every day. We created daily mini-incentives (airtime/lunch) for 'Fastest Start' or 'Most Visits'. Seeing me in the trenches with them changed the energy. We hit the weekly target, but more importantly, belief was restored."

### 4. Financial Hygiene
**Question:** "Why is financial hygiene important in sales?"
**Answer:** "Sales without hygiene is just 'Vanity'. Unreconciled accounts lead to disputes, which lead to partners stopping orders. I prioritize weekly reconciliations and strict credit limits to ensure the 'pipe' remains unblocked. A healthy distributor is a selling distributor."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "For the Central Region specifically, is the current priority **Width** (more outlets) or **Depth** (more SKUs per outlet)?"
2.  "What is the biggest challenge the current field force is facing with the distributor network right now?"
3.  "How does Unilever support the ASM in terms of real-time data visibility for field teams?"
