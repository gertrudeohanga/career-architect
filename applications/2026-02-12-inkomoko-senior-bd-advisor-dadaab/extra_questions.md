# Extra Application Questions (Inkomoko Portal)

## 1. Available Date
**Recommendation:** **03/16/2026** (MM/DD/YYYY)
- *Reasoning:* This represents a standard **1 Month Notice** period from extended employment. It shows professionalism (you won't just dump your current employer) but are ready to move relatively soon.

## 2. Desired Pay
**Recommendation:** **120,000**
- *Reasoning:*
    -   **Base:** Your current/market rate is ~80k-90k.
    -   **Seniority:** This is a "Senior" Advisor role.
    -   **Location:** Dadaab is a hardship location. Hardship roles typically command a 20-30% premium or allowance.
    -   **Strategy:** 120,000 is a competitive rate for an NGO Senior Officer level in a field office. It's not too high to disqualify, but respects the hardship context.
    -   *If the field accepts text:* Enter "120,000 KES (Negotiable)".
