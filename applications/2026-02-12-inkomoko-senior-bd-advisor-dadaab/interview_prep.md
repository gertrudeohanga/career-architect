# Interview Preparation

## Company Research
-   **Mission:** Improving livelihoods of utilizing entrepreneurship. "Largest investor to refugee entrepreneurs in Africa."
-   **Values:** Purpose, Achievement, Improvement, Bravery, "We Eat Goat" (Celebration/Solidarity).
-   **Context:** Dadaab is a complex environment. Requires cultural sensitivity and resilience.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The "Dadaab" Question
**Question:** "Why do you want to work in Dadaab? It's a hardship area."
**Answer:** "I studied Gender and Development because I wanted to work in the field, not just an office. The challenges of Dadaab—resource constraints, unique market dynamics—are exactly where I feel my skills in *creative* business problem solving will be most useful. I am resilient, adaptable, and I view this as a career-defining opportunity, not a hardship."

### 2. Advising Micro-Entrepreneurs
**Question:** "A client has revenue but no profit. How do you advise them?"
**Answer:** "I start with the **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)** analysis.
1.  Are they pricing correctly?
2.  Are they accounting for hidden costs (transport, waste, family use)?
3.  I sit with them and do a 'product costing' exercise. Often, they are subsidizing their business without knowing it."

### 3. Managing a Team
**Question:** "How do you ensure quality when your BAs are in the field and you are in the office?"
**Answer:** "Quality Assurance starts with **Standardization**.
1.  Do we have a standard 'Site Visit Checklist'?
2.  I do 'Shadow Visits' (join them randomly) to observe their consulting style.
3.  I hold weekly 'Case Study' meetings where we discuss a difficult client together so everyone learns."

### 4. Cultural Sensitivity
**Question:** "How do you handle a male client who refuses to listen to a female advisor?"
**Answer:** "I leverage my training in Gender dynamics. I remain professional and focus on **Value**. 'I am here to help you make more money.' Once they see that my advice leads to profit, the barrier usually lowers. I also ensure I respect cultural protocols (dress, greeting) to build initial rapport."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What are the primary sectors the entrepreneurs in Dadaab are operating in (Retail, Ag, Services)?"
2.  "How does the Business Growth Services team collaborate with the Access to Finance team for clients who need capital?"
3.  "What does success look like for a client in the first 6 months of our engagement?"
