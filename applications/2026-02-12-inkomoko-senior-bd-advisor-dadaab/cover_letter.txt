Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my deep interest in the Senior Business
Development Advisor role at Inkomoko in Dadaab. It is rare to find a
role that so perfectly intersects my academic background in Gender and
Development with my professional career in Business Growth Services and
Fintech.

I have spent the last five years working with MSMEs and entrepreneurs in
Kenya, helping them formalize, digitize, and grow. I understand that for
a refugee entrepreneur, a business is not just an income; it is dignity,
resilience, and a future.

Why I am the right fit:

1. Business Growth & Advisory Experience: At Tenakata and Kwendo, my
core role was advisory. I didn’t just sell a product; I sat down with
shopkeepers and micro-entrepreneurs to teach them how to track profits,
separate finances, and use digital tools. I have conducted site visits,
diagnosed business health, and provided actionable plans for
growth—exactly what your “Business Assessment” responsibility entails.

2. Training & Capacity Building: I have a passion for knowledge
transfer. I have trained hundreds of clients on financial literacy and
digital adoption. Furthermore, in my current role, I mentor junior
Business Associates, reviewing their work and helping them improve their
consulting skills. I am ready to step into the “50% Management”
component of this role immediately.

3. Commitment to the Mission: My degree in Gender and Development from
Egerton University gave me the theoretical framework to understand the
unique challenges faced by marginalized communities, particularly women.
My career in Fintech gave me the practical tools to solve those
challenges. I am fully prepared for the environment in Dadaab and am
eager to contribute to Inkomoko’s vision of inclusive economic growth.

I am ready to bring my energy, compassion (“We Eat Goat”), and
professional rigor to the team in Dadaab.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
