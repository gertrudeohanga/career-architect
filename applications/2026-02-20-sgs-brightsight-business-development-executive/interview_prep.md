## Weak Point Analysis & Defense

### Gap 1: No TIC/EHS Industry Experience

**Defense Strategy**:
- "While I haven't worked specifically in Testing, Inspection and Certification, I've consistently demonstrated the ability to master new industries quickly. At Kwendo, I transitioned from microfinance to HR-tech within 30 days. The fundamentals of B2B sales—understanding client needs, building relationships, managing pipeline—apply across industries. I'm committed to investing the time to learn SGS's service portfolio thoroughly."

### Gap 2: Different Degree Field

**Defense Strategy**:
- "My degree is in Gender and Development, not Commerce. However, I've compensated through 5+ years of practical sales experience, consistently exceeding targets by 20-30%. The skills I've developed—lead generation, negotiation, CRM management, client relationships—are directly applicable to this role."

### Gap 3: No Import/Export Experience

**Defense Strategy**:
- "While I don't have direct import/export experience, I've sold complex B2B services requiring understanding of regulatory compliance and documentation—similar skills to cross-border trade. I'm confident in my ability to learn the specifics of international trade certification."
