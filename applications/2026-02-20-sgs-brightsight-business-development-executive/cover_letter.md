Dear SGS Hiring Team,

The opportunity to join SGS as a Business Development Executive resonates strongly with my career trajectory—I've spent over five years building B2B client relationships, exceeding sales targets, and managing pipelines in dynamic industries, and I'm eager to bring this experience to the world's leading Testing, Inspection and Certification company. Your 145-year legacy of Swiss precision and commitment to quality, compliance, and sustainability represents exactly the kind of organization where results-driven sales professionals can make meaningful impact.

My track record demonstrates consistent delivery against ambitious sales objectives. At Ngao Credit, I achieved 120% of monthly targets through systematic lead identification and relationship-focused selling, while at My-Credit Limited, I drove 130% of annual acquisition goals by combining market research with strategic client engagement. Currently at Kwendo, I manage the full sales cycle—from identifying and qualifying B2B leads to negotiating commercial agreements and monitoring key account revenue. I maintain healthy pipelines through rigorous CRM discipline, prepare weekly reports and monthly forecasts, and actively participate in industry events to build market presence.

While my background is in fintech and HR-tech rather than Testing/Inspection/Certification services, I've consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly master complex B2B offerings and translate technical value propositions into client wins. The skills that drive success in B2B sales—lead qualification, relationship building, pipeline management, and contract negotiation—transfer directly to SGS's service portfolio. I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to represent a global brand with such strong credentials in quality and compliance.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my sales experience and proven target achievement can contribute to SGS's commercial growth objectives in Kenya. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
