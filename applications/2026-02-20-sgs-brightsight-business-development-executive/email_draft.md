## Email Body

Subject: Application: Business Development Executive - Nairobi | 5+ Years B2B Sales, 120% Target Achievement

Dear SGS Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Business Development Executive position based in Nairobi. With 5+ years of B2B sales experience and a consistent track record of exceeding targets by 120-130%, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to SGS's commercial growth as the world's leading Testing, Inspection and Certification company.

**Why I'm a Strong Fit:**

- **Proven Sales Results**: Consistently achieved 120-130% of monthly/annual targets across multiple roles
- **Full Sales Cycle Ownership**: Experience identifying leads, pitching services, negotiating contracts, and managing key accounts
- **CRM Proficiency**: Skilled in pipeline management, weekly reporting, and monthly forecasting
- **Relationship Focus**: 35% repeat business rate through strong client relationship management
- **Market Intelligence**: Track record of analyzing trends to identify sales opportunities

I am particularly drawn to SGS's 145-year legacy of Swiss precision and commitment to quality, compliance, and sustainability. While my background is in fintech and HR-tech, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly master new industries and translate complex value propositions into client wins.

I have attached my resume and cover letter for your review. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my sales experience can support SGS's commercial objectives in Kenya.

Thank you for considering my application.

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
