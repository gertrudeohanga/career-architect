# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: Fashion Retail Ops
*Since you lack direct fashion experience, you must master the vocabulary.*

-   **ASP (Average Selling Price):** Price per item.
-   **ATV (Average Transaction Value) / Basket Size:** Total spend per customer.
-   **Conversion Rate:** % of walk-ins who buy.
-   **UPT (Units Per Transaction):** How many items they buy.
-   **Shrinkage:** Theft or lost stock.
-   **Visual Merchandising (VM):** How the store looks.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The Pivot Question
**Question:** "You have no Fashion experience. How can you manage our stores?"
**Answer:** "Retail Operations is 80% **Execution** and 20% Product. While I will rely on my Merchandising counterparts for the fashion trends, my expertise is in the **80%**: Ensuring the doors open on time, the staff are trained, the SOPs are followed, and the revenue targets are hit. I bring a discipline from the Financial Sector that can actually tighten up your operations."

### 2. Multi-Store Management
**Question:** "How do you manage a store you can't visit every day?"
**Answer:** "I manage through **Cluster Leads** and **Data**.
1.  **Morning Dashboard:** I check yesterday's numbers (Rev vs Target, Conversion) by 9 AM.
2.  **Exception Reporting:** I focus on the outliers—the best store (to learn why) and the worst store (to fix why).
3.  **Structured Routines:** I have a set rhythm of store visits—not just 'pop-ins', but structured audits using a checklist."

### 3. Handling Poor Performance
**Question:** "A store is consistently missing target. What do you do?"
**Answer:** "I diagnose the 'Why' using the **Retail Equation**: Traffic x Conversion x Value.
-   Is **Traffic** down? (Marketing/Location issue).
-   Is **Conversion** down? (Staffing/Product/Service issue).
-   Is **Basket Size** down? (Upselling issue).
Once I isolate the variable, I build an action plan with the Store Manager—e.g., 'This week we focus purely on add-on selling at the till to boost UPT'."

### 4. Shrinkage (Theft/Loss)
**Question:** "How do you control shrinkage?"
**Answer:** "In my previous role, 'shrinkage' was 'Portfolio at Risk'—money lost. I control it through:
1.  **Process:** Strict receiving and transfer procedures.
2.  **Culture:** Ensuring staff understand that shrinkage kills their bonus.
3.  **Visible Leadership:** Conducting random spot checks (cycle counts)."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "Is the current priority for the Operations team more on **Driving Top-line Sales** or **Controlling Operational Costs**?"
2.  "How autonomous are the Cluster Managers currently, and what is the biggest gap in their capability?"
3.  "What digital tools does the field team use for real-time reporting?"
