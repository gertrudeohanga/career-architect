# Extra Application Questions (CDL Portal)

## 1. Current Job Title / Occupation
**Recommendation:** Change from "Business Development Manager" to **"Regional Operations Manager"** (if the field is editable).
- *Reasoning:* Your resume explicitly frames your role at Kwendo as "Regional Operations Lead". This title is more relevant to the "Senior Retail Operations Manager" job you are applying for and helps pass the initial keyword scan.

## 2. Job Level
**Selected:** **Manager**
- *Review:* Correct. This matches the "Senior" requirement.

## 3. Experience in Years
**Selected:** **5**
- *Strategy:* The JD asks for **8+ years**.
- *Recommendation:* If you have *any* relevant work prior to 2021 (internships, family business, part-time retail), consider bumping this to **6 or 7**. However, ensure your resume supports it.
- *Risk:* "5" might be an auto-filter threshold. If you can justify **6+** with cumulative project work, do so.

## 4. Highest Academic Qualification
**Selected:** **Bachelors**
- *Review:* Correct.

## 5. Select at most 3 industries you have worked in

**3. Retail & FMCG** (Strategic Stretch) OR **Other**
