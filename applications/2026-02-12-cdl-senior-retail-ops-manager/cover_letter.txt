Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Retail Operations
Manager position. While my background is rooted in the operational
scaling of Fintech and Financial Services networks, the core challenges
of your role—managing distributed clusters, driving unit-level
performance, and enforcing standard operating procedures—are
unparalleled in my experience managing 50+ partner outlets and
optimizing regional field operations.

I am an Operations Manager who looks at a territory map and sees a P&L.
Here is how my experience translates to Fashion Retail Operations:

1. Multi-Unit Performance Management: At My-Credit Limited, I acted as
the “Cluster Manager” for a network of over 50 independent partner
units. My role was not just sales; it was Operational Viability. I
monitored daily activity, managed liquidity (stock equivalent), and
ensured every unit met its revenue targets. This rigour in managing a
distributed network is directly transferable to managing a cluster of
retail stores.

2. SOPs and Brand Consistency: In financial services, compliance is
non-negotiable. I have spent the last 5 years enforcing Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) across field teams to ensure that every
client interaction meets the brand’s quality and legal standards. I
bring this same discipline to ensuring visual merchandising and service
standards are upheld across a retail footprint.

3. People Leadership & Succession: I have built and led teams of up to
30 staff. My leadership style is coaching-centric. I believe in spending
time in the field (on the “shop floor”) to observe behaviors, correct
issues in real-time, and identify the next generation of leaders. I
don’t manage from a spreadsheet; I manage from the front line.

4. Operational Efficiency: I am obsessed with efficiency. Whether it is
optimizing route plans to save fuel costs or managing credit portfolios
to reduce “shrinkage” (risk), I effectively manage the bottom line. I
understand that Retail Operations is a game of margins, and I know how
to protect them.

I am eager to bring my operational grit, commercial acumen, and fresh
perspective to your Retail Operations team.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
