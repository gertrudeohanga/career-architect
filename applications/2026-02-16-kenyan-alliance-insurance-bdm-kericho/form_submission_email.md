Dear Ms. Riari,

Good evening and thank you for this opportunity.

Please find attached my completed Candidate Profile Form as requested. I have also included my professional photo as specified.

I am genuinely excited about the prospect of joining Kenyan Alliance Insurance and contributing to the General Business growth in Kericho. The opportunity to build a career with such a respected institution in the insurance industry aligns perfectly with my professional goals.

I remain available for the virtual interview at your earliest convenience next week and can adjust my schedule to accommodate any time that works best for you.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or documentation in the meantime.

Thank you once again for considering my application.

Kind regards,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
