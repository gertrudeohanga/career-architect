# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: General Insurance
*You need to speak the language of "Risk Transfer".*

-   **General Business:** Motor, Fire, Theft, WIBA (Work Injury Benefits), Marine, Engineering. (Non-Life).
-   **Underwriting:** Assessing the risk.
-   **Claims Ratio:** Claims paid vs Premiums collected.
-   **Broker vs Agent:** Broker represents client; Agent represents insurer.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The COP Question
**Question:** "You don't have your COP yet. How will you sell?"
**Answer:** "I am currently enrolled and pursuing the certification aggressively. However, my sales skills are ready *now*. I have sold 'Asset Finance products' which are 90% similar to Motor Insurance in terms of the client conversation. I can generate the leads and work with a licensed underwriter to close the technical paperwork while I finalize my cert."

### 2. Sourcing New Business in Kericho
**Question:** "How will you grow the book in Kericho?"
**Answer:** "I will focus on **Aggregators**.
1.  **Tea/Agriculture:** Kericho is tea country. I will approach Saccos and factories to offer group WIBA and Asset All Risks.
2.  **Motor Dealers:** I will reconnect with my Asset Finance network to capture the Motor insurance business at the point of sale.
3.  **Cross-sell:** I will review the existing client list and call every single one to offer a second product (e.g., specific Fire cover for a Motor client)."

### 3. Broker Management
**Question:** "How do you manage brokers who demand high commissions?"
**Answer:** "Brokers want two things: **Speed** and **Commission**. Since commission is regulated/capped, I compete on **Speed**. 'If you bring the business to Kenyan Alliance, I will get you the policy document in 2 hours, not 2 days.' Service level is my competitive advantage."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What is the current mix of the Kericho book—is it heavily Motor-dependent, and are you looking to diversify into Fire/Engineering?"
2.  "Does the branch have dedicated underwriting support, or will I be doing the quotation generation myself?"
3.  "What are the top 3 brokers currently supporting the branch?"
