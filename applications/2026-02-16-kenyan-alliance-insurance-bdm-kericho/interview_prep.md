# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: General Insurance
*You need to speak the language of "Risk Transfer".*

-   **General Business:** Motor, Fire, Theft, WIBA (Work Injury Benefits), Marine, Engineering. (Non-Life).
-   **Underwriting:** Assessing the risk.
-   **Claims Ratio:** Claims paid vs Premiums collected.
-   **Broker vs Agent:** Broker represents client; Agent represents insurer.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The COP Question
**Question:** "You don't have your COP yet. How will you sell?"
**Answer:** "I am currently enrolled and pursuing the certification aggressively. However, my sales skills are ready *now*. I have sold 'Asset Finance products' which are 90% similar to Motor Insurance in terms of the client conversation. I can generate the leads and work with a licensed underwriter to close the technical paperwork while I finalize my cert."

### 2. Sourcing New Business in Kericho
**Question:** "How will you grow the book in Kericho?"
**Answer:** "I will focus on **Aggregators**.
1.  **Tea/Agriculture:** Kericho is tea country. I will approach Saccos and factories to offer group WIBA and Asset All Risks.
2.  **Motor Dealers:** I will reconnect with my Asset Finance network to capture the Motor insurance business at the point of sale.
3.  **Cross-sell:** I will review the existing client list and call every single one to offer a second product (e.g., specific Fire cover for a Motor client)."

### 3. Broker Management
**Question:** "How do you manage brokers who demand high commissions?"
**Answer:** "Brokers want two things: **Speed** and **Commission**. Since commission is regulated/capped, I compete on **Speed**. 'If you bring the business to Kenyan Alliance, I will get you the policy document in 2 hours, not 2 days.' Service level is my competitive advantage."

## Behavioral Questions

### 4. Tell Us About Yourself
**Question:** "Walk us through your background and why you're here today."
**Answer:** "I'm a Business Development professional with over 5 years in financial services—microfinance, asset finance, and fintech. At My-Credit, I grew the portfolio by 120% in 18 months. At Ngao Credit, I worked closely with insurance partners on motor vehicle coverage for logbook loans—that's where I discovered my passion for the insurance industry. I'm now pursuing my COP and specifically targeting Kenyan Alliance because of your strong General Business presence. Kericho represents an exciting opportunity to build something substantial in a market I understand—agriculture, Saccos, and SMEs."

### 5. Why Insurance? Why Now?
**Question:** "You've been in microfinance and fintech. Why switch to insurance?"
**Answer:** "Three reasons: First, **career stability**—insurance is a regulated, professional industry with clear certification pathways. Second, **transferable skills**—the sales cycle in asset finance mirrors insurance: assess risk, price appropriately, manage the relationship. Third, **timing**—I've built 5 years of financial services networks that I can now monetize in insurance. Every logbook loan client needs motor cover. Every SME needs WIBA and fire cover. I'm not starting from zero—I'm bringing a pipeline."

### 6. Greatest Strength
**Question:** "What would you say is your greatest strength?"
**Answer:** "My **hunter mentality**. I don't wait for leads—I create them. At My-Credit, I personally recruited and registered 50+ partner groups. At Ngao Credit, I built relationships with car dealers who became my lead source. I wake up thinking about where the next client is coming from. In insurance, that means I'll be knocking on factory doors in Kericho, visiting Saccos, and calling every motor dealer in the region."

### 7. Greatest Weakness
**Question:** "What's your biggest weakness?"
**Answer:** "I can be impatient with slow decision-makers. When I see a clear opportunity, I want to close it quickly. I've learned to balance this by understanding that some clients—especially corporates—have procurement processes. So I now plan my pipeline with a mix: quick wins for momentum, and longer-cycle deals for big premiums. I've also learned to use the waiting time productively—nurturing the relationship rather than just pushing for a signature."

### 8. Handling Rejection
**Question:** "How do you handle rejection in sales?"
**Answer:** "I reframe it. A 'no' today is information, not failure. I ask: 'What would need to change for this to be a yes?' Sometimes it's timing—they just renewed elsewhere. I note the renewal date and follow up 60 days before. Sometimes it's price—I explore what coverage they actually need versus what I quoted. Sometimes it's trust—they don't know Kenyan Alliance yet. I solve that by offering to cover a small policy first to demonstrate service. Rejection is just the beginning of the relationship."

### 9. Working Under Pressure
**Question:** "Describe a time you worked under pressure to meet a target."
**Answer (SAR):**
- **Situation:** At My-Credit, I was 40% below quarterly target with 3 weeks remaining.
- **Action:** I analyzed my pipeline, identified 15 warm prospects who had stalled, and personally visited each one. I offered a limited-time incentive for immediate sign-up and asked existing clients for referrals with a small reward.
- **Result:** Closed 12 of the 15 prospects and exceeded my quarterly target by 5%. Learned that personal visits beat phone calls when you're behind.

### 10. Difficult Client Situation
**Question:** "Tell us about a difficult client you had to manage."
**Answer (SAR):**
- **Situation:** At Ngao Credit, a client's logbook loan was approved but he became aggressive when the insurance valuation came lower than expected, threatening to go to a competitor.
- **Action:** I listened without interrupting, acknowledged his frustration, then explained the valuation process step-by-step. I offered to get a second valuation if he could provide service records showing recent upgrades. I also showed him competitor rates to demonstrate we were fair.
- **Result:** He calmed down, accepted the original valuation, and later referred two friends. He said, "You're the first person who actually explained things to me."

## Technical/Product Questions

### 11. Insurance Products Knowledge
**Question:** "What General Insurance products do you know?"
**Answer:** 
- **Motor Private/Commercial:** Third-party and comprehensive covers
- **Fire & Perils:** Property protection for businesses and homes
- **WIBA (Work Injury Benefits Act):** Mandatory employer cover for employee injuries
- **Burglary/Theft:** Stock and asset protection
- **Public Liability:** Protection against third-party injury/damage claims
- **Professional Indemnity:** For professionals (doctors, lawyers, accountants)
- **Marine/Goods in Transit:** Cargo protection
- **Engineering/Contractor's All Risk:** Construction project covers
- **Fidelity Guarantee:** Protection against employee fraud

### 12. Calculating Premiums
**Question:** "How is a motor insurance premium calculated?"
**Answer:** "Premium = Sum Insured × Rate. The rate depends on: vehicle type (private vs commercial vs PSV), age, engine capacity, use, claims history, and security features. Comprehensive is typically 4-7% of value for private vehicles. Third-party is a flat rate. Excess applies on claims—usually 10% of claim amount or a minimum figure."

### 13. Claims Process
**Question:** "A client calls saying they've had an accident. What do you tell them?"
**Answer:** "First, ensure everyone is safe. Then:
1. Don't admit liability at the scene
2. Take photos of damage, other vehicle, and scene
3. Get police abstract within 24 hours
4. Notify us immediately—don't delay
5. Don't repair before inspection
6. Complete claim form with all details
I follow up to ensure documents reach claims department and keep the client updated. A good claims experience = renewal."

### 14. Underwriting Basics
**Question:** "What factors affect underwriting decisions?"
**Answer:** "Underwriting assesses risk to price appropriately. Key factors:
- **Moral hazard:** Is this client likely to be careless or fraudulent?
- **Physical hazard:** What's the actual risk? (e.g., wooden building vs concrete for fire)
- **Claims history:** Previous losses indicate future risk
- **Sum insured accuracy:** Over-insurance invites fraud; under-insurance means disputes
- **Occupation/Use:** A taxi has more exposure than a personal car
My job in BD is to bring quality risks and provide complete, accurate information so underwriting can price competitively."

## Role-Specific Questions

### 15. First 90 Days Plan
**Question:** "What would you do in your first 90 days?"
**Answer:**
**Days 1-30 (Learn):**
- Study all products, rates, and underwriting guidelines
- Shadow top performers; understand systems and processes
- Map Kericho market: key industries, competitors, existing clients
- Meet the top 10 existing clients to understand their needs

**Days 31-60 (Connect):**
- Visit every broker and agent in the region—introduce myself
- Identify 20 high-potential prospects (Saccos, factories, dealers)
- Start cross-selling calls to existing book
- Establish weekly activity rhythm

**Days 61-90 (Produce):**
- Close first new business deals
- Build referral pipeline from early wins
- Present growth plan to management with target segments identified
- Achieve or exceed first quarter targets

### 16. Revenue Targets
**Question:** "We expect KES 3M in new premiums quarterly. Can you deliver?"
**Answer:** "Yes. Let me break it down: KES 3M quarterly = KES 1M monthly = KES 250K weekly. That's approximately:
- 5 comprehensive motor policies at KES 50K each, OR
- 2 WIBA policies for 50-person companies, OR
- 1 fire policy for a factory + 3 motors

My strategy: focus on **aggregators** (Saccos, factories) for volume, supplement with individual motors from dealer relationships. I've consistently exceeded targets—120% at My-Credit, regularly beating monthly targets at Ngao Credit. I'm confident."

### 17. Competition
**Question:** "How will you compete against established insurers with bigger brands?"
**Answer:** "Three ways:
1. **Service speed:** I respond in hours, not days. Clients remember who picked up the phone.
2. **Local presence:** I'll be visible in Kericho—attending events, visiting businesses. Big insurers send someone from Nairobi occasionally.
3. **Relationship depth:** I'll know my clients' businesses, their renewal dates, their growth plans. When they need advice, they call me first.
Brand matters less than the person in front of them. That person is me."

### 18. Broker vs Direct Business
**Question:** "Would you focus on brokers or direct clients?"
**Answer:** "Both, but differently:
- **Brokers:** Quick volume. I'll service them exceptionally—fast quotes, quick policy issuance. They control corporate business.
- **Direct clients:** Higher margins, stronger relationships. I'll hunt SMEs, Saccos, and individuals directly.
Target mix: 60% direct, 40% broker. This balances volume with relationship depth and margin protection."

### 19. Relocation to Kericho
**Question:** "Are you prepared to relocate to Kericho?"
**Answer:** "Absolutely. I've already researched accommodation options and I'm ready to move within 30 days of offer. Kericho is a strategic market—tea industry, growing SME sector, underserved by insurance. I see this as an opportunity to build something significant, not a posting to endure. I'm committed to being embedded in the community."

## Potential Curveball Questions

### 20. Salary Expectations
**Question:** "What are your salary expectations?"
**Answer:** "Based on the market and my experience, I'm looking at KES 70,000-90,000 basic, plus commission structure. However, I'm more interested in the commission model—if the commission is strong and uncapped, I'm flexible on basic. I want to be rewarded for performance. Can you share how the commission structure works?"

### 21. Why Kenyan Alliance?
**Question:** "Why Kenyan Alliance specifically?"
**Answer:** "Three reasons:
1. **Reputation:** Established brand with strong General Business portfolio—clients trust the name.
2. **Growth opportunity:** Kericho expansion means I can build, not just maintain. I want to be part of growth.
3. **Professional environment:** Insurance is regulated, and Kenyan Alliance has strong governance. I want to build my career properly."

### 22. Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?
**Question:** "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
**Answer:** "In 5 years, I want to be a Branch Manager or Regional Head, leading a team and overseeing multiple product lines. To get there, I'll complete my COP, pursue the Diploma in Insurance, consistently exceed targets, and develop people skills by mentoring new team members. Kenyan Alliance has clear career paths, which is why I'm here."

### 23. What If You Don't Get COP?
**Question:** "What if you fail the COP exam?"
**Answer:** "I won't. But if I did, I'd retake it immediately. The COP is not optional for me—it's my professional foundation. I'm studying seriously: past papers, study groups, and practice. I treat it like a target I have to hit, just like sales quotas."
