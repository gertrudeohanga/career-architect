# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: Kenyan Alliance Insurance (Established player).
- **Role**: Business Development Manager (General Business).
- **Location**: Kericho (Regional Role).
- **Critical Requirement**: **COP (Certificate of Proficiency)** in Insurance.

## Match Assessment: 4/10 🛑 Low Match (Missing Certification)

### The Dealbreaker
1.  **COP Requirements:** The JD explicitly asks for "Certificate of Proficiency (COP)".
    -   **Status:** You do *not* list this in your master profile. In Kenya, you often strictly cannot sell insurance without this regulatory certification.
2.  **Industry Experience:** They ask for "5 years in Insurance". You have 5 years in *Credit/Asset Finance*. While related, insurance sales is a different product cycle.

### The Bridge (If we proceed)
-   **Asset Finance:** We can argue that "Logbook Loans" (Ngao) required understanding insurance (valuation/comprehensive cover).
-   **Sales is Sales:** You have the 5 years of field sales experience.
-   **Kericho Location:** If you have any link to Kericho, that's a plus (willingness to work region).

## Protocol Check
**Score is < 5/10.**
As per your instruction ("request for the go ahead before you proceed"), I am pausing here.

> **Decision Required:**
> Do you have a COP (Certificate of Proficiency) that we forgot to list?
> OR do you want to apply anyway and say you are "Willing to undertake COP immediately"?
