## Behavioral Questions

I am strategically transitioning into the insurance industry because it represents the ideal convergence of my strengths and long-term career goals:

1. **Industry Stability & Growth:** Insurance offers a regulated, sustainable career path with clear professional progression through certifications (COP, ACII, etc.)

2. **Transferable Skills Application:** My 5+ years in financial services—sourcing new business, managing client relationships, cross-selling products, and exceeding sales targets—translates directly to insurance business development.

3. **Network Leverage:** Through my work in asset finance and secured lending at Ngao Credit, I have developed relationships with car dealers, fleet owners, and SME clients who require Motor and General Insurance products.

4. **Professional Development:** I have already enrolled for the Certificate of Proficiency (COP) in Insurance, demonstrating my commitment to building a long-term career in this sector.

5. **Kenyan Alliance Specifically:** The company's strong market presence in General Business and its Kericho expansion offer the perfect platform to apply my proven "hunter" business development approach while building expertise in insurance.

### What has been your biggest or most significant achievement/accomplishment in the past 5 years?

**Growing a Microfinance Portfolio by 120% in 18 Months at My-Credit Limited**

**Situation:** When I joined My-Credit Limited in 2022, the company was struggling to expand its client base in a competitive microfinance market with established players dominating key segments.

**Action:** I implemented a systematic business development approach:
- Developed a structured client recruitment process targeting SME groups and chamas
- Built a network of 50+ partner groups through relationship-focused engagement
- Created a referral program incentivizing existing clients to bring new business
- Conducted rigorous business viability assessments ensuring portfolio quality while scaling
- Cross-sold complementary products to maximize revenue per client

**Result:** 
- Achieved **120% portfolio growth** within 18 months
- Maintained **90% client retention rate** despite aggressive acquisition
- Established sustainable client relationships that continued generating referrals
- Received recognition as a top performer, leading to my promotion trajectory

This achievement demonstrates my ability to source new business aggressively while maintaining quality—exactly the balance required for insurance business development.

### What has been your biggest mistake, challenge or failure to date and what did you learn from it?

**Challenge: Underestimating the Importance of Product Knowledge in Early Career**

**Situation:** In my first business development role at Schmsoft Ventures (2021), I was eager to close deals quickly and focused heavily on relationship building and sales pitches without deeply understanding the technical aspects of the software products I was selling.

**What Happened:** Several deals fell through during final negotiations when prospects asked detailed technical questions I couldn't answer confidently. I lost credibility with some prospects and missed quota in my first quarter.

**What I Learned:**
1. **Product expertise builds client trust:** Clients need to know you understand their challenges and how your product solves them specifically.
2. **Preparation prevents lost opportunities:** I now invest significant time mastering product features, competitor comparisons, and common objections before client meetings.
3. **Ask for help early:** I learned to collaborate with technical teams and subject matter experts rather than trying to handle everything alone.

**How I Applied This Learning:**
- At Ngao Credit, I became an expert in logbook loan processes, asset valuation, and insurance requirements—enabling me to answer any client question confidently.
- I am now proactively pursuing COP certification to ensure I have deep insurance product knowledge before engaging prospects at Kenyan Alliance.

This experience shaped my philosophy: never sell what you don't deeply understand.

### What is your ideal future career plan and what's most important to you?

**5-Year Vision:** Become a **Branch Manager or Regional Business Development Head** within the insurance industry, leading a high-performing sales team and driving significant General Business growth.

**Key Milestones:**
- **Year 1-2:** Excel as BDM at Kenyan Alliance, exceed targets, and complete COP certification
- **Year 2-3:** Pursue Diploma in Insurance (DIP) while building a strong production track record
- **Year 3-5:** Progress to Senior BDM or Branch Management role with team leadership responsibilities

**What's Most Important to Me:**

1. **Career Growth & Learning:** I want to work in an organization that invests in employee development and provides clear progression pathways.

2. **Impact & Recognition:** I am motivated by measurable results and being recognized for exceeding targets and contributing to organizational growth.

3. **Stability & Professionalism:** Insurance offers the regulatory framework and professional standards that align with my desire for a long-term, respected career.

4. **Client Relationships:** I find deep satisfaction in building lasting client relationships where I become a trusted advisor rather than just a salesperson.

5. **Financial Growth:** I want my income to reflect my contributions through a fair commission structure that rewards high performance.

### What would you say are your key natural strengths, skills and abilities?

1. **"Hunter" Business Development Mentality:** I thrive on prospecting, cold outreach, and converting new business. I don't wait for leads—I create them through systematic outreach and relationship building.

2. **Relationship Building & Trust:** I have a natural ability to connect with people, understand their needs, and build long-term trust. This has resulted in 35% repeat business and 90% client retention across my roles.

3. **Resilience & Persistence:** Sales involves rejection. I maintain positive energy and activity levels regardless of setbacks, knowing that consistent effort produces results.

4. **Cross-Selling & Upselling:** I naturally identify opportunities to offer additional products and services that genuinely benefit clients, increasing revenue per relationship.

5. **Systematic Execution:** I am disciplined about tracking activities, managing pipelines, and reporting results. I don't rely on luck—I follow processes that produce predictable outcomes.

6. **Adaptability:** I have successfully transitioned across fintech, microfinance, HR-tech, and asset finance—quickly learning new products and industries.

7. **Communication:** Strong verbal and written communication in English and Swahili, enabling effective engagement with diverse client segments.

### What would you say are your natural weaknesses and most under-developed skills?

1. **Technical Insurance Knowledge (Currently Developing):** I am new to the insurance industry and still building my technical product knowledge. However, I am addressing this proactively by pursuing COP certification and committing to intensive self-study.

2. **Impatience with Slow Decision-Makers:** My "hunter" nature sometimes makes me push too hard on prospects who need more time. I am learning to balance urgency with patience and nurture longer sales cycles appropriately.

3. **Delegation:** I tend to want to handle client relationships personally rather than delegating. As I progress into leadership roles, I need to develop the ability to trust and empower team members.

4. **Data Analysis & Reporting Tools:** While I am proficient in basic reporting, I could strengthen my skills in advanced Excel and business intelligence tools for deeper sales analytics.

**Mitigation Approach:** I believe weaknesses are just undeveloped strengths. I actively seek feedback, invest in training, and practice deliberately to turn weaknesses into capabilities.

### What is the best environment you have ever worked in and why?

**My-Credit Limited (2022-2024)** provided the best working environment I've experienced:

**Why It Worked for Me:**

1. **Clear Targets & Accountability:** Monthly and quarterly targets were clearly defined, and performance was measured transparently. I knew exactly what was expected and could track my progress.

2. **Autonomy with Support:** I had the freedom to manage my territory and client relationships independently, while having access to management support when needed.

3. **Team Collaboration:** Despite individual targets, the culture encouraged knowledge sharing and celebrating team wins. We learned from each other's successes and challenges.

4. **Recognition for Performance:** High performers were acknowledged publicly and rewarded through commissions and growth opportunities. This motivated everyone to excel.

5. **Client-Centric Values:** The organization genuinely cared about client outcomes, not just sales numbers. This aligned with my personal values around building lasting relationships.

**What I'm Looking For:** An environment that combines clear performance expectations with supportive management, autonomy with accountability, and individual achievement with team collaboration—which I believe Kenyan Alliance offers.

7. **Compliance & Documentation:** Strengthened attention to regulatory requirements and proper documentation—critical for insurance industry success.
