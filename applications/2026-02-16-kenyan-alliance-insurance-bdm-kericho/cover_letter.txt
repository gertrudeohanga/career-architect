Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Business Development
Manager - General Business position at Kenyan Alliance Insurance. As a
seasoned sales professional with over 5 years of experience in the Asset
Finance and Lending sector (Ngao Credit, My-Credit), I understand the
critical relationship between Insurance and Finance. I am eager to bring
my “hunter” mentality and network of commercial clients to drive growth
for your Kericho branch.

Why I am the right fit:

1. Sourcing New Business: The core of my career has been Origination. At
Ngao Credit, I didn’t wait for leads; I built a network of car dealers
and brokers to source Logbook Loans. This required a deep understanding
of Motor Insurance (Comprehensive/Third Party) as a prerequisite for
lending. I am ready to apply this same aggressive sourcing strategy to
General Business insurance products.

2. Cross-Marketing & Upselling: At Kwendo and My-Credit, my success
depended on increasing the “Share of Wallet.” I successfully cross-sold
additional credit products to my portfolio of 50+ partner groups. I
understand that the easiest sale is to an existing happy customer, and I
have the relationship management skills to execute this.

3. Insurance Knowledge & Certification: Through my work in secured
lending, I have gained practical knowledge of insurance principles,
valuation, and risk. I am currently pursuing my Certificate of
Proficiency (COP) to formalize this knowledge and ensure full regulatory
compliance. I am committed to completing this certification rapidly.

4. Regional Experience: I have experience developing new markets and
managing regional portfolios (recently leading Central Region expansion
for Kwendo). I am prepared to hit the ground running in Kericho to
capture market share.

I am confident that my sales drive and relationship network will
translate into immediate production numbers for Kenyan Alliance.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
