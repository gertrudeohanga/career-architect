Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Business Developer Wholesale position at Decathlon. With over six years of proven success in B2B partnership development, market expansion, and commercial relationship management across East Africa, I bring a track record of converting market opportunities into long-term, profitable partnerships. At Kwendo, I built strategic relationships with 8+ partners, negotiated commercial agreements, developed onboarding strategies, and coordinated with internal teams (technical, finance, operations) to ensure smooth operational setup—skills that translate directly to developing wholesale channels with resellers, distributors, and major companies. I drove 30% year-over-year market expansion at My-Credit Limited across 8+ Kenyan counties through systematic market mapping and client acquisition, and I achieved an 85% retention rate at Kwendo through proactive account management. I am based in Nairobi with extensive East Africa market knowledge and am genuinely excited about the opportunity to drive Decathlon's wholesale expansion across the region while building scalable commercial foundations aligned with your strategic goals.

My experience developing B2B partnerships and managing the complete acquisition cycle directly aligns with this role's core responsibilities. At Kwendo, I led the end-to-end acquisition process for 15+ African businesses—building qualified pipelines, conducting market mapping, negotiating commercial terms, and creating onboarding strategies that ensured seamless integration with internal teams. I coordinated cross-functional collaboration between business development, supply, finance, and digital teams, which is exactly what's required for setting up new wholesale partners at Decathlon. Additionally, I have strong experience monitoring account performance during the growth phase: at Ngao Credit, I managed 200+ client accounts, identified quick wins to accelerate growth, and built a 40% repeat business rate through proactive support and relationship management. My approach to account development—monitoring performance metrics, organizing training and support, and identifying upselling opportunities—mirrors the 3-6 month account ramp-up responsibility before handover to Key Account Managers.

What excites me most about Decathlon is the opportunity to contribute to making sports accessible across East Africa while building a career with clear progression to director-level roles. I bring strong market analysis capabilities—at Kwendo, I conducted research across 5 target segments, gathered competitive intelligence, and identified $500K+ in new opportunities. I have experience assessing business viability and commercial potential for 150+ SMEs at My-Credit Limited, which has given me deep understanding of business economics, margin management, and pricing structures. While my background is in fintech and financial services rather than sports retail specifically, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly master new industries and markets. I successfully transitioned across gender development, financial services, fintech, and HR-tech sectors, rapidly developing expertise and delivering results in each domain. I am committed to intensive learning about wholesale distribution models, sports retail dynamics, and Decathlon's product portfolio to become an effective business developer for your East African expansion.

I am immediately available and excited about the opportunity to leverage my B2B partnership development expertise, market expansion capabilities, and East Africa market knowledge to drive Decathlon's wholesale channel growth. The role's career path potential—with progression to Country Wholesale Director, Country Business Director, and Regional Director positions—aligns perfectly with my professional ambitions. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven track record in building commercial partnerships, driving market expansion, and accelerating account growth can contribute to Decathlon's success in East Africa.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
