Dear TLC Worldwide Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Business Development Manager position in your Nairobi office. With 5+ years building sales pipelines and closing deals across fintech, HR-tech, and financial services, I'm ready to bring my relationship-driven approach to help TLC expand its presence in African markets.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

- **Proven pipeline builder**: Currently driving market expansion at Kwendo, where I've grown the client base to 15+ businesses through systematic outreach and consultative selling
- **Target exceeder**: Consistently achieved 120-130% of sales targets through disciplined pipeline management and needs-based qualification
- **C-suite confidence**: Experienced leading senior-level conversations and delivering data-driven proposals that demonstrate clear ROI
- **Scale-up mindset**: Thrive in fast-paced environments with ownership of outcomes—exactly the culture TLC celebrates

I'm particularly drawn to TLC's approach of driving customer behavior through experience-led rewards rather than discounting. This mirrors my philosophy that genuine relationships and demonstrated value outperform transactional tactics.

Please find my resume and cover letter attached. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to TLC's growth.

Best regards,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
