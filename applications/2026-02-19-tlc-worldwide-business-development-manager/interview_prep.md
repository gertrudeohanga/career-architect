## Weak Point Defense

**Potential concern**: Limited direct experience with 6-7 figure single deals; no MarTech/loyalty industry background

**Likely question**: "Can you give an example of closing a deal in the $100K+ range? How does your fintech experience translate to loyalty marketing?"

**Your pivot**:
- Aggregate value: "While individual deals varied, my cumulative portfolio impact at My-Credit exceeded significant value, and at Kwendo I'm managing accounts with substantial annual contract value"
- Transferable skills: "The mechanics are identical—understand customer pain points, demonstrate ROI, build relationships, close consultatively. In fintech, we drove behavioral change through financial products; TLC does the same through experiences. Both require data-driven proposals and C-suite confidence"
- Fast learner: "My transition from microfinance to HR-tech proved I can master new domains quickly. I'm confident the loyalty/rewards space follows similar B2B dynamics"

## Questions to Ask Them

1. **Role-specific**: "What does the first 90 days look like for a successful BDM in this role? What would you consider early wins?"

2. **Pipeline/targets**: "Can you share more about the target structure and how pipeline metrics are tracked? What's the typical deal cycle length for strategic vs. tactical programs?"

3. **Market focus**: "Which sectors or verticals are you prioritizing for growth in African markets? Are there specific types of brands you're targeting?"

4. **Product/platform**: "How does the COSMOS platform differentiate TLC's proposals in competitive situations? What role does the BDM play in shaping proposals with the platform team?"

5. **Culture/growth**: "TLC mentions strong learning & development—what opportunities exist for BDMs to grow into larger accounts or leadership roles?"

6. **Team structure**: "How is the Nairobi team structured? Will I be collaborating with global colleagues on cross-border opportunities?"
