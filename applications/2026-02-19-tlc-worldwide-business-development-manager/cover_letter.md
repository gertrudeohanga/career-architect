Dear Hiring Team,

When I learned that TLC Worldwide is expanding its Nairobi hub to bring experience-led rewards to African markets, I immediately recognized the parallel with my work at Kwendo—where we're proving that the right engagement strategy can transform how businesses connect with their customers. Your 30-year track record of helping global brands shift customer behavior through emotionally engaging rewards, rather than costly discounting, aligns precisely with my approach to business development: building relationships that drive measurable ROI and genuine brand loyalty.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I've built and owned the sales pipeline for a platform serving Africa's informal workforce—a market segment that requires consultative selling, C-suite confidence, and the ability to demonstrate clear value. I've expanded our client base to 15+ businesses by delivering tailored, data-driven proposals that address both operational efficiency and customer engagement challenges. Previously at Ngao Credit, I consistently exceeded targets by 120% through a systematic approach to pipeline management and needs-based qualification. This combination of entrepreneurial drive and disciplined execution has prepared me to win high-value deals in the fast-paced, scale-up environment that defines TLC.

What excites me most about TLC is your commitment to building genuine brand love—not through transactional discounts, but through meaningful experiences. My career has been anchored in this same philosophy: at Schmsoft Ventures, I developed relationship management protocols that prioritized long-term partnerships over quick wins; at My-Credit, I trained teams on consultative approaches that improved client retention. Your COSMOS platform's ability to deliver personalized campaigns at scale resonates with my experience leveraging CRM and data tools to drive strategic account growth. I'm also drawn to TLC's culture of ownership—from the Owner's Club to TLC Rise—which mirrors my own belief that the best results come when everyone has skin in the game.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my pipeline-building expertise and relationship-driven approach can contribute to TLC's growth in African markets. I'm available at your convenience and look forward to the conversation.

Warm regards,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
