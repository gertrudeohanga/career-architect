Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Business Development Executive position at Moja EV Kenya LTD. With over 6 years of proven success driving sales growth, conducting market research, and building lasting customer relationships across fintech, HR-tech, and financial services sectors, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Kenya's growing electric vehicle ecosystem. My track record of consistently exceeding sales targets while educating customers on innovative products positions me to drive EV adoption and achieve ambitious sales goals at Moja EV.

Throughout my career, I have specialized in consultative selling of innovative, technology-driven products that require customer education and trust-building. At Kwendo, I led business development for a digital payroll platform, expanding market presence across African businesses by conducting targeted market research, developing strategic partnerships, and optimizing customer adoption strategies. This experience taught me how to translate complex technical solutions into compelling value propositions for diverse customer segments. Similarly, at Ngao Credit Limited, I exceeded monthly sales targets by 15-25% over 12 months by implementing systematic lead generation strategies and providing exceptional customer service throughout the sales cycle. These achievements demonstrate my ability to drive sales performance while maintaining high customer satisfaction - skills directly transferable to selling electric vehicles in an emerging market.

What excites me most about Moja EV Kenya is the opportunity to be part of Kenya's clean energy transition and sustainable transportation revolution. Having worked extensively in financial inclusion and community development, I understand the transformative impact that innovative solutions can have on people's lives and businesses. I am passionate about bringing this same commitment to helping Kenyan businesses and individuals adopt electric vehicle technology. My experience conducting market research across diverse sectors, combined with my strong communication and negotiation skills, will enable me to effectively identify customer needs, conduct competitive analysis, and position Moja EV's products for maximum market impact.

I am eager to bring my proven sales expertise, customer relationship management capabilities, and adaptability to new industries to the Business Development Executive role at Moja EV Kenya. I am committed to quickly mastering electric vehicle technology and the automotive sector, and I am actively pursuing my driver's license to meet all role requirements. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in driving adoption of innovative solutions can contribute to Moja EV's growth and Kenya's sustainable transportation future.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
