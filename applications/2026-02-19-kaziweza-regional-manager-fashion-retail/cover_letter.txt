Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Regional Manager - Fashion Retail position
at Kaziweza Limited. With over six years of progressive leadership
experience managing multi-location operations across East Africa, I
bring a proven track record of driving commercial success, operational
efficiency, and performance excellence that directly aligns with your
requirements. While my background is in financial services and HR-tech
rather than fashion retail, I have consistently demonstrated the ability
to quickly master new industries while delivering exceptional results.
At Kwendo, I led business development across 15+ African businesses,
managing geographically dispersed operations, building strategic
stakeholder relationships, and achieving 85% client retention through
systematic performance management—skills that translate directly to
managing fashion retail stores across Uganda and Rwanda. I am a native
Swahili speaker with deep East Africa market knowledge, and I am
immediately available and enthusiastic about relocating to Kampala to
drive Kaziweza’s regional growth.

My experience managing multi-location operations mirrors the core
requirements of this role. At Kwendo, I coordinated business development
across 15+ African businesses, conducting regular site visits, ensuring
consistent service delivery standards, and collaborating with HQ to
align regional execution with overall brand strategy. I consistently
exceeded revenue targets by 25% at Ngao Credit through KPI-driven
performance management, implementing corrective actions when gaps
emerged, and analyzing customer feedback to inform strategic decisions.
At My-Credit Limited, I drove 30% year-over-year growth across 8
counties by monitoring conversion rates, allocating resources
strategically, and training staff on operational standards—improving
team capability by 40%. These experiences have equipped me with the
commercial acumen, operational discipline, and people leadership skills
essential for driving retail KPIs including conversion, basket size, and
MSI across Kaziweza’s stores.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to apply my
stakeholder management and market intelligence capabilities to the
fashion retail sector. Throughout my career, I have built and maintained
strategic relationships with diverse stakeholders—from the 8+ financial
service partners and suppliers I coordinated with at Kwendo, to the
landlords, banks, and regulators I engaged across multiple roles. I have
represented organizations in key business forums, negotiated agreements,
and resolved operational challenges across geographically dispersed
locations. Additionally, my track record of conducting market research,
analyzing competitive trends, and providing HQ with actionable insights
positions me to effectively share local market intelligence from Uganda
and Rwanda, coordinate country-specific marketing campaigns, and
identify growth opportunities. While I am new to fashion retail
specifically, I bring fresh perspective, proven learning agility (having
successfully transitioned across gender development, financial services,
fintech, and HR-tech sectors), and genuine enthusiasm for mastering
product knowledge, visual merchandising standards, and brand execution
in this dynamic industry.

I am immediately available for relocation to Kampala and excited about
the opportunity to lead Kaziweza’s operations across Uganda and Rwanda.
As a native Swahili speaker with extensive East Africa experience, I
understand the regional market dynamics and am comfortable with the
frequent travel requirements between Kampala and Kigali. I am confident
that my multi-location operations management experience, KPI-driven
performance approach, stakeholder relationship capabilities, and people
leadership skills will enable me to drive commercial success and
operational excellence for Kaziweza. I would welcome the opportunity to
discuss how my transferable skills and fresh industry perspective can
contribute to your regional growth objectives.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking
with you soon.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
