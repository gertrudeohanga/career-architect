- Emphasize people management, stakeholder relationships, and commercial acumen
- Highlight Microsoft Excel/PowerPoint proficiency and data analysis
- Include Swahili language prominently (valuable for East Africa markets)

- Draw parallels between financial services and fashion retail (both are relationship businesses requiring product knowledge and customer experience excellence)
- Emphasize relocation readiness and excitement about Kampala/Kigali markets

- Demonstrate understanding of visual merchandising basics
- Highlight examples of quickly mastering new products and industries
- Prepare questions about training/onboarding for fashion retail transition

## ⚠️ Critical Considerations

### Industry Transition Risk
**Challenge**: No direct fashion retail experience in a role requiring "5+ years of leadership experience managing multi-store or multi-country operations in the Fashion Retail Industry"

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Emphasize transferable skills over industry experience
- Position as "operations and commercial leader" rather than "fashion retail specialist"
- Demonstrate learning agility and quick industry mastery track record
- Offer to undergo intensive product/merchandising training
- Leverage East Africa market knowledge as differentiator

### Relocation Requirement
**Consideration**: Position based in Kampala, Uganda (outside Kenya)

**Positive Factors**:
- Candidate is open to relocation within East Africa per identity.json
- Salary range (KSh 150,000-200,000) aligns with expectations (90,000-200,000)
- Native Swahili speaker (valuable for Uganda/Rwanda markets)
- Experience working across multiple locations demonstrates adaptability

**Questions to Ask**:
- What relocation support is provided?
- What is the housing/cost of living situation in Kampala?
- How frequently is travel to Kigali required?
- What is the onboarding process for someone new to fashion retail?

### Compensation Alignment
**Salary Range**: KSh 150,000 - 200,000 per month

**Assessment**: Upper end (KSh 200,000) aligns with candidate's expectations. This is a senior-level role with significant responsibility, so negotiating toward the higher end is reasonable given the relocation requirement and multi-country scope.
