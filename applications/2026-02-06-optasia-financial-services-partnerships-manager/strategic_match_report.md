| JD Requirement | Your Experience | Match |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Fintech Ecosystem** | Kwendo & Tenakata experience | ✅ Strong |
| **Relationship Management** | "Managed 50+ key accounts", C-Level engagement | ✅ Strong |

### Gaps / Areas to Frame

| JD Requirement | Status | Strategy |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| **Treasury Management** | ⚠️ Sales Focus | Frame "Liquidity" understanding from Fintech/Lending context (loan disbursement). |
| **Corporate Banking RM** | ⚠️ Fintech RM | Highlight "Corporate Clients" acquisition at Kwendo as equivalent. |
| **Tech/Coding Guidelines** | ❌ None | Ignore (likely error in JD for a non-tech role) or focus on "willingness to learn". |

### Key Strategy
The role is essentially a **Strategic Account Manager** for Banks using Optasia's tech.
Your experience at **Kwendo** is vital here—it shows you understand the tech/fintech side.
Your experience at **My-Credit/Ngao** shows you understand the *product* (lending/credit scoring) that Optasia facilitates.
Frame yourself as a "Bridge" between the Partners (Banks) and the Platform (Optasia).

## Recommendation
