### Fintech Ecosystem

**Q: "Tell us about a time you resolved an operational issue."**
*Answer:* "At Kwendo, we had a client whose onboarding was delayed due to documentation issues. I set up a direct line between their compliance team and our internal ops team, created a shared checklist, and held daily 15-min standups until it was resolved. We launched only 2 days late instead of 2 weeks."

## Technical Awareness (The "Bonus" Skills)
- **Treasury/Liquidity:** "I understand that for a lending product to work, the 'float' or liquidity must be monitored. If the float account runs dry, disbursements fail, and customer trust breaks."
