Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Financial Services Partnerships Manager – East Africa position at Optasia. With a robust background in the fintech and digital lending space (Kwendo, My-Credit, Ngao Credit), I have spent over five years managing relationships with financial partners, coordinating operations, and driving the adoption of financial inclusion technologies.

In my current role at Kwendo, I effectively function as a partnership manager for our B2B clients, serving as the primary bridge between their business needs and our technical solutions. I coordinate cross-functional efforts to ensure seamless onboarding, monitor operational KPIs, and ensure that our service delivery aligns with commercial agreements. This mirrors the core responsibilities of the FSP Manager role—ensuring that the integration between the platform and the partner is smooth, profitable, and compliant.

My experience at My-Credit Limited gave me deep exposure to the "decisioning, disbursement, and collection" lifecycle that Optasia facilitates. I managed a portfolio of over 50 partner groups, handling the operational realities of credit scoring eligibility and loan processing. I understand the critical importance of liquidity, timely reporting, and regulatory compliance in the lending ecosystem.

I am passionate about Optasia’s mission of enabling financial inclusion. I bring a "customer-first mindset" and a "go-getter spirit" that aligns perfectly with your values. My ability to analyze performance data, resolve operational bottlenecks, and build trust with stakeholders makes me well-positioned to grow Optasia’s presence in the East African market.

I would be thrilled to discuss how my operational experience in Kenya’s fintech sector can contribute to the success of your banking and FSP partnerships. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
