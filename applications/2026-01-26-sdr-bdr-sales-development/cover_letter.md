**Subject: Application for SDR/BDR Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the SDR/BDR position. With over 5 years of consistent sales performance and business development experience across financial services, I am confident in my ability to immediately contribute to your client outreach and lead generation efforts.

My sales background includes extensive experience in client outreach, relationship management, and CRM systems. At Ngao Credit Limited, I consistently exceeded monthly sales targets through systematic lead generation and follow-up strategies, while maintaining accurate CRM records that supported data-driven decision-making. At Schmsoft Ventures, I built and maintained relationships with over 200 clients, gathering comprehensive customer information that informed product recommendations and improved service delivery.

I have proven experience managing CRM systems and conducting client outreach across multiple financial service organizations. My role at My-Credit Limited involved driving sales of microfinance products through targeted client acquisition, while at Tenakata Enterprise, I led loan mobilization initiatives that expanded the client portfolio through systematic outreach and engagement.

My communication skills are well-suited for the SDR/BDR role. I have professional fluency in English (9.0-10.0 level) and native Swahili proficiency, with extensive experience in client communication across diverse populations. I maintain a friendly and professional phone demeanor and have strong interpersonal skills that enable me to build rapport quickly with potential clients.

I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns perfectly with my strengths in sales development, client engagement, and systematic follow-up. I am self-motivated, organized, and excellent at managing multiple priorities while maintaining attention to detail. My experience in service-based industries has prepared me well for understanding client needs and effectively communicating value propositions.

I am immediately available and excited about the opportunity to bring my sales experience, CRM expertise, and client communication skills to your team. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in business development and consistent sales performance can help drive your lead generation and client outreach efforts.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
