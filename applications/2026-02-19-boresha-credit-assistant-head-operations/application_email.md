Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Assistant Head of Operations position at Boresha Credit Services Limited as advertised. Please find attached my resume and cover letter for your consideration.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Gender and Development from Egerton University and bring over six years of progressive experience in financial services operations, including operational strategy implementation, team performance monitoring, KPI tracking, and compliance management. My background includes:

- **Operational Management**: Implemented operational strategies improving efficiency by 30% at Kwendo; achieved 100% compliance with regulatory requirements at Tenakata Enterprise
- **Team Leadership**: Trained staff improving team capability by 40% at My-Credit Limited; coached 15+ team members at Schmsoft Ventures
- **Financial Services Operations**: Managed loan processing, payment tracking, and reconciliation for 200+ clients; monitored portfolio performance and outstanding balances
- **Reporting & Documentation**: Compiled operational and performance reports within stipulated timelines; maintained accurate records and documentation

While my background is in loan origination and business development rather than debt collection specifically, I have extensive experience with payment tracking, following up on missing payments, account management, and coordinating with teams to resolve payment issues—skills that are directly transferable to collections operations. I am genuinely interested in transitioning my financial services operations expertise to the debt collection sector and am committed to rapidly developing deep expertise in collections management.

I am based in Nairobi with immediate availability and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my operational management capabilities, team leadership experience, and financial services background can contribute to Boresha Credit Services Limited's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

**Getrude Kasinga Ohanga**
