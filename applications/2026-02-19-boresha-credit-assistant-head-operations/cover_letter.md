Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Assistant Head of Operations position at Boresha Credit Services Limited. With a bachelor's degree in a relevant field and over six years of progressive experience in financial services operations, I bring a proven track record of implementing operational strategies, monitoring team performance, and ensuring compliance with organizational standards. While my background is in loan origination and business development rather than debt collection specifically, I have extensive experience with the core operational competencies this role requires: KPI tracking and performance monitoring, team leadership and coaching, operational reporting and documentation, payment tracking and reconciliation, and customer account management. At Tenakata Enterprise, I achieved 100% compliance with all operational and regulatory reporting requirements. At My-Credit Limited, I trained staff improving team capability by 40% while managing a portfolio of 150+ accounts and ensuring 95%+ payment compliance. I am based in Nairobi with immediate availability and am genuinely interested in transitioning my financial services operations expertise to the debt collection sector.

I understand that this role requires debt collection experience, and I want to address this directly. While I have not worked specifically in debt collection operations, my six years in financial services have provided me with highly transferable operational skills. At Ngao Credit Limited, I managed the complete loan lifecycle for 200+ clients including payment tracking, following up on missing payments, coordinating with internal teams to resolve payment issues, and escalating delinquent accounts to management—activities that parallel collections operations. At My-Credit Limited, I monitored repayment schedules for 150+ accounts, ensured 95%+ payment compliance through systematic follow-up, and supported reconciliation processes. Additionally, my experience compiling operational reports, tracking outstanding balances, maintaining accurate documentation, and working with customer information systems directly aligns with the reporting and monitoring responsibilities of this role. I have consistently demonstrated the ability to work with confidential financial information, identify discrepancies in account records, and enforce adherence to company policies and procedures.

What attracts me to Boresha Credit Services Limited is the opportunity to apply my operational management capabilities in a leadership role within Kenya's leading debt collection firm. I bring strong team leadership experience—at My-Credit, I trained staff on operational procedures improving team capability by 40%, and at Schmsoft Ventures, I coached 15+ team members on service standards reducing complaints by 50%. I am skilled at conducting regular team meetings, one-on-one coaching sessions, and performance reviews to ensure adherence to quality standards. My analytical and problem-solving abilities—demonstrated through assessing 150+ SMEs and implementing process improvements that reduced implementation time by 30% at Kwendo—position me to effectively monitor collections performance, identify gaps, and escalate risks for management action. I am also proficient in MS Office and customer information systems, with a keen eye for detail and the ability to work within tight timelines.

I recognize that transitioning from loan origination to debt collection operations represents a career pivot, and I am committed to rapidly developing deep expertise in collections management through your training and mentorship. I am genuinely interested in the operational challenges of debt collection and believe my financial services background, combined with my strong operational management skills, team leadership capabilities, and proven ability to quickly master new domains, will enable me to contribute effectively to your operations team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my transferable skills and commitment to operational excellence can support Boresha Credit Services Limited's continued success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
