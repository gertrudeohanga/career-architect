### Gaps / Areas to Frame

| JD Requirement | Status | Strategy |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| **Oracle/ERP Experience** | ⚠️ Generic Fintech | Frame "Financial Solutions" as complex systems sales. |
| **Hospitality Sector** | ⚠️ General B2B | Highlight any hotel/hospitality clients from past roles. |
| **Pre-sales Collaboration** | ⚠️ Sales Agent focus | Highlight collaboration with "internal teams" at Kwendo. |

### Key Strategy
Pesapal is a payments company, but this role is specifically selling **Oracle Hospitality Software** (PMS/POS systems).
Your experience at **Kwendo** (Fintech) is the most relevant. You need to leverage the "Fintech/Tech Sales" angle heavily.
Frame your sales process as "Consultative Solution Selling" (diagnosing problems, offering complex solutions) rather than just "selling products".

## Recommendation
