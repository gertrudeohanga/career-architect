Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Business Development Manager position (Hospitality Sector) at Pesapal. With over five years of experience in business development and solution selling within the fintech and financial services sectors, I am confident in my ability to drive the adoption of Oracle Hospitality software solutions and build lasting relationships with enterprise clients.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I specialize in identifying new business opportunities and engaging mid-sized to enterprise businesses to understand their operational challenges. I utilize a consultative sales approach to map client needs to appropriate technology solutions, managing complex sales cycles from initial contact to close. My efforts have resulted in the acquisition of over 100 corporate clients, a testament to my ability to build a strong pipeline and negotiate commercial terms effectively.

I understand that selling Oracle Hospitality solutions requires more than just a product pitch; it requires acting as a trusted advisor who understands digital transformation. My experience at My-Credit Limited, where I achieved 120% of my annual revenue targets, honed my skills in stakeholder engagement—navigating conversations with Finance, Operations, and Executive teams to align our solutions with their business goals. I am proficient in using CRM tools to track performance and managing data-driven sales strategies.

While my background is in financial technology, the core competency of mapping complex business systems to client needs is directly transferable. I am a quick learner with a strong understanding of enterprise IT environments and a passion for technology that empowers businesses. I am eager to bring my results-driven approach and strong relationship management skills to the Pesapal team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in enterprise sales and solution selling can contribute to the growth of Pesapal’s Hospitality division. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
