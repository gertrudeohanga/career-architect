Subject: Application for Business Development Specialist II, ESARO

Dear Hiring Team,

Please accept my application for the Business Development Specialist II position.

With a Bachelor’s in Gender and Development and over 5 years of experience in Private Sector Resource Mobilization, I offer a unique "hybrid" skillset. I combine the theoretical understanding of development frameworks (Gender, Social Inclusion) with the aggressive execution and capture planning discipline of the commercial sector.

Key Highlights:
*   Resource Mobilization: Lead writer for commercial proposals and concept notes, securing partnerships for Fintech expansion.
*   Private Sector Engagement (PSE): Expert in designing market-based interventions that align with donor priorities for sustainable development.
*   Writing & Coordination: Experienced in coordinating cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality, compliant proposals under tight deadlines.

I am eager to translate my private sector efficiency into impactful wins for CRS's institutional funding portfolio.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
