# Interview Preparation

## Industry Context: Institutional Funding (NGO)
*You need to pivot your vocabulary from "Sales" to "Grants".*

-   **Capture Planning:** The pre-work before a proposal (Intelligence gathering, donor engagement).
-   **Theory of Change (ToC):** The logic model of how activities lead to outcomes.
-   **Logframe:** Logical Framework (matrix of Objectives, Indicators, Means of Verification).
-   **Cost Recovery:** Ensuring the budget covers overheads (NICRA).
-   **Consortium:** Group of NGOs partnering for a bid (Lead vs Sub).

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. The Experience Gap (8 Years vs 5 Years)
**Question:** "This role requires 8 years in International Development. You have 5 in Fintech. Why you?"
**Answer:** "I bring the **Private Sector Engagement (PSE)** lens that many traditional donors (USAID, World Bank) are now prioritizing. While I haven't spent 8 years writing Logframes, I have spent 5 years *executing* market-based development solutions. I know what sustainability actually looks like when the grant money runs out. I can write proposals that are realistic and commercially viable."

### 2. Proposal Coordination
**Question:** "Describe a time you managed a difficult team to a deadline."
**Answer:** "At Kwendo, involved coordinating the Technical Product Team (who wanted to build X) and the Finance Team (who said we could only afford Y) for a big partnership bid. I set up a 'Compliance Matrix' early on, assigned clear sections, and held daily 15-minute stand-ups. We submitted 24 hours early."

### 3. Writing Skills
**Question:** "How do you ensure a proposal has a 'single voice' when written by 5 people?"
**Answer:** "As the **Lead Writer**, I don't just copy-paste. I create a 'Style Guide' and 'Annotated Outline' first. Once inputs come in, I do a 'One Voice Edit'—rewriting sections to ensure the narrative flow, terminology, and tone are consistent throughout the document."

### 4. Catholic Social Teaching (CST)
**Question:** "What do you know about CRS values?"
**Answer:** "I know CRS is guided by principles like **Human Dignity**, **Subsidiarity** (decisions made at the most local level possible), and **Solidarity**. My background in Gender & Development taught me that development isn't about 'saving' people, it's about empowering them to live with dignity."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "Is this role focused more on **USG** (USAID) funding or **European** (EU/FCDO) funding? My writing style adapts differently to each."
2.  "How does the ESARO team balance 'reactive' bidding (RFPs) vs 'proactive' positioning?"
3.  "What is the team's current win-rate, and what is the biggest bottleneck in the current BD cycle?"
