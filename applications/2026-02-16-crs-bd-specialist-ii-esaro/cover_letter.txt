Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Business Development
Specialist II position. As a Development Practitioner (BA in Gender &
Development) who has spent the last five years in the high-pressure
environment of Private Sector Fintech, I offer a unique perspective: the
ability to design evidence-based interventions combined with the
aggressive “win rates” of commercial sales.

While my title has often been “Manager,” my role has been Resource
Mobilization. Whether pitching to a Venture Capitalist or structuring a
partnership for MSME digitization, the discipline is the same: rigorous
capture planning, responsive proposal writing, and strategic
positioning.

Why my “Hybrid” Background adds value to CRS:

1. High-Quality Proposal Production: In the private sector, a “bad
proposal” doesn’t just get rejected; it loses money immediately. I have
honed my writing skills to be concise, compelling, and compliant. I
understand that a proposal must weave a “Golden Thread” from the problem
statement to the budget. My academic background ensures I can speak the
language of Gender Mainstreaming, MEAL, and Social Inclusion fluently
within these documents.

2. Private Sector Engagement (PSE): The development world is
increasingly looking to the private sector for sustainable solutions. At
Tenakata and Kwendo, I worked at the intersection of technology and
development, designing solutions that solved real-world problems
(financial exclusion) through market mechanisms. I can help CRS position
itself as a partner of choice for donors looking for innovative,
market-based approaches.

3. Coordination & Process Management: I have managed complex,
cross-functional teams to deliver projects on tight deadlines. I am
comfortable being the “Proposal Coordinator” who chases inputs from
technical experts, finances, and partners to ensure a cohesive
submission.

4. Alignment with Mission: My degree in Gender and Development was not
an accident; it was a vocation. After gaining “hard skills” in business
management, I am eager to return to the Development sector to apply
these frameworks to CRS’ mandate of serving the global poor.

I am ready to bring a fresh, competitive edge to your Institutional
Funding Team.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
