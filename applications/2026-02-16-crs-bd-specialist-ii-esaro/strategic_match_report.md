# Strategic Match Report

## Company & Role

- **Company**: CRS (Top-tier International NGO).
- **Role**: Business Development Specialist II (Regional/Remote).
- **Core Function**: **Grant Writing** and **Proposal Management** for Institutional Donors (USAID, EU, etc.).

## Match Assessment: 5/10 ⚠️ Significant Reach

### The Gap (Why this is hard)
1.  **Experience:** They want **8 Years** in **International Development**. You have ~5 years in *Private Sector/Fintech Sales*.
2.  **Function:** This role is about *Grant Writing* (Technical Proposals), not *Commercial Sales*. They use terms like "Capture Planning", "Go/No-go", "Theory of Change". Your experience is "Lead Generation" and "Closing Deals".
3.  **Donors:** They specifically ask for experience with **World Bank, FCDO, EU, USG**. Most of your history is selling to MSMEs or individuals.

### The Bridge (The "Transferable Skills" Argument)
To have any chance, we must completely reframe your profile from "Sales" to "Resource Mobilization".
-   **Writing:** You have written proposals and concept notes at Kwendo/Tenakata. We must elevate this to sound like "Technical Proposal Writing".
-   **Degree:** Your **BA in Gender and Development** is your strongest asset here. It gives you the *vocabulary* of development (MEAL, Gender Mainstreaming, Social Impact) even if your work has been commercial.
-   **Private Sector Engagement:** NGOs are increasingly looking for "Private Sector Partnerships". You can sell yourself as the expert in *Private Sector Engagement (PSE)*, bringing a commercial mindset to development.

## Recommendation

> ⚠️ **Proceed with Caution (Stretch Application)**
> 
> This is a "level up" role.
> **Strategy:**
> 1.  **The "Hybrid" Narrative:** "I am a Development Practitioner (Degree) with Private Sector discipline (Experience)."
> 2.  **Focus on Writing:** The cover letter must be a masterpiece of writing, as "Exceptional Writing" is a key requirement.
> 3.  **Don't fake the Donor exp:** Admit you are from the private sector but frame it as an advantage ("I write to win business, not just to fill forms").

**Protocol Check:** Score is 5/10. I will proceed but mark it as a "Stretch" in your task list.
