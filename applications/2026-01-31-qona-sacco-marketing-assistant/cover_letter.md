Dear Hiring Manager,

With over five years of experience driving member recruitment, loan product sales, and relationship management in Kenya's financial services sector, I am excited to apply for the Marketing Assistant position at QONA SACCO. Your commitment to empowering members through accessible and sustainable financial solutions resonates deeply with my own career mission of advancing financial inclusion.

In my current role as Business Development Manager at Kwendo, I lead field-based initiatives that have expanded our client base to over 100 businesses while enabling financial access for previously unbanked workers. Previously at My-Credit Limited, I facilitated the recruitment and registration of 50+ client groups, marketed microfinance products achieving 120% of annual targets, and processed over 500 loan applications while maintaining portfolio quality. At Ngao Credit, I consistently exceeded monthly sales targets through systematic lead generation, resulting in a 30% repeat business rate from satisfied clients. This hands-on experience in member recruitment, cross-selling, and loan penetration directly aligns with QONA SACCO's growth objectives.

What draws me to QONA SACCO is your member-focused cooperative model. Having worked extensively with group-based lending structures and community financial services, I understand the unique dynamics of cooperative financial institutions. My experience conducting market research and providing management feedback on client needs, combined with my passion for customer advocacy, positions me to contribute meaningfully to enhancing QONA SACCO's brand visibility and member satisfaction. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to drive loan penetration and build lasting referral networks that support your membership growth strategy.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in financial services marketing can support QONA SACCO's expansion goals. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at ohanga.gertrude@gmail.com or +254 706 573 273.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
