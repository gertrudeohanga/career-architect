# Extra Application Questions (Fuzu)

## 1. Why are you interested in this role?
"I am passionate about technology's ability to transform business efficiency. Having spent the last year driving the adoption of HR-Tech and Fintech solutions at Kwendo, I’ve seen firsthand how the right software can solve critical operational headaches for companies. Matrix Vision Sytems' focus on 'smarter technology interoperability' aligns perfectly with my desire to sell high-impact, enterprise-grade solutions. I want to move beyond selling single products to becoming a strategic partner for corporate clients, helping them modernize their infrastructure with your diverse software portfolio."

## 2. What makes you stand out for this role?
"I bring a rare blend of **aggressive sales capability** and **consultative problem-solving**. While many salespeople focus only on closing, I focus on the 'Needs Assessment'—diagnosing the client's pain points (e.g., inefficiency, fraud, compliance) before prescribing a solution. This approach helped me achieve **120% of my revenue targets** in my previous role. Additionally, my background in selling complex financial and HR-tech products means I am comfortable navigating long B2B sales cycles and building trust with C-level stakeholders, ensuring not just a sale, but a long-term partnership."
