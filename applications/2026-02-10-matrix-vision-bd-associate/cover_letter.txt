Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Business Development
Associate – Corporate Software Sales position at Matrix Vision Systems.
As a business development professional who has spent the last year
driving the adoption of Fintech and HR-Tech solutions at Kwendo, I am
excited about the opportunity to bring my consultative sales approach to
your team.

At Matrix Vision, you need more than just a salesperson; you need a
partner who can bridge the gap between technical innovation and business
value. Here is why I am the right fit:

1. Enterprise Software Sales Experience: At Kwendo, I am currently
leading B2B sales for a payroll digitization platform. I deal daily with
the challenges of introducing new software to corporate
clients—overcoming resistance to change, demonstrating ROI, and
navigating multi-stakeholder decision-making processes. I don’t just
sell a product; I sell a solution to operational inefficiencies.

2. Consultative & Relationship-Driven: My background in financial
services (My-Credit, Ngao) honed my ability to build trust with C-level
executives and business owners. I approach every sale with a “Needs
Assessment” mindset—diagnosing the client’s pain points before offering
a solution. This approach has consistently helped me exceed targets,
including achieving 120% of my revenue goals at My-Credit.

3. Strategic Market Development: I understand the Kenyan corporate
landscape. I have built pipelines from scratch, identifying
opportunities not just through traditional channels but by understanding
emerging industry trends. I am eager to apply this proactive mindset to
mining opportunities on platforms like EGP and expanding Matrix Vision’s
footprint.

I am passionate about technology’s role in driving business efficiency.
I am ready to hit the ground running, leverage my existing corporate
network, and drive revenue growth for your software division.

Sincerely,

Getrude Kasinga Ohanga
