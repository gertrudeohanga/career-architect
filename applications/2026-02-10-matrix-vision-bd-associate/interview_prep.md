# Interview Preparation

## Company Research
- **Name:** Matrix Vision Systems Ltd.
- **Focus:** Engineering, Security, and **Software-Integrated Solutions**.
- **Mission:** Driving smarter technology interoperability in Africa.
- **Role Context:** They are looking for someone to grow the **Corporate Software** division specifically. This likely implies they have proprietary software or resell enterprise solutions (ERP/Security software) that need a dedicated sales push.

## Core Interview Themes

### 1. "Software" Sales Experience
**Question:** "You have a lot of financial experience. Have you sold software before?"
**Answer:** "Yes, absolutely. At **Kwendo**, the core product is a **Fintech/HR-Tech Platform**. I sell a digital solution that integrates with a company's HR and Finance systems. The sales cycle involves demos, technical stakeholder buy-in, and proving ROI—exactly like any enterprise software sale."

### 2. The Sales Cycle
**Question:** "Walk me through a deal you closed from start to finish."
**Answer:**
- **Discovery:** "Identified a logistics company struggling with manual payroll for casuals."
- **Qualification:** "Met the HR Director to confirm budget and pain points (ghost workers)."
- **Solution:** "Demonstrated how Kwendo automates this."
- **Closing:** "Negotiated the contract terms and oversaw the pilot implementation."

### 3. Public Procurement (EGP/MyGov)
*Note: This is a gap in your resume, so prepare a strong learning answer.*
**Question:** "Do you have experience with government tenders?"
**Answer:** "While my primary focus has been private sector B2B, I am familiar with the requirements of public sector compliance (Tax Compliance, CR12, etc.) from my time working with regulated financial institutions. I am quick to learn the specific navigation of EGP execution and can apply my rigorous documentation skills to tender preparation."

### 4. Consultative Selling
**Question:** "How do you handle a client who says 'It's too expensive'?"
**Answer:** "I pivot to **Value**. 'Expensive compared to what? The cost of your current manual errors or fraud?' I work to quantify the problem they have, so the price of the solution looks small in comparison."

## Questions to Ask Them
1.  "What specific software products are the primary focus for this role in Q1/Q2 (e.g., Security, ERP, Custom Dev)?"
2.  "Is the current strategy more focused on hunting new logos or farming existing engineering clients for software upselling?"
3.  "How does the sales team collaborate with the technical engineering team during the pre-sales process?"
